## 📘 **Executive Summary**


#### 🎯 **Purpose of the Lecture**

This opening lecture sets the foundation for **health economics** by introducing key concepts, the rationale for economic thinking in health, and the course structure. It explains **why economics matters in health care** and how we can apply economic reasoning to make better decisions for individuals, institutions, and society.

#### 🌍 **Global Relevance of Health Economics**

- The **COVID-19 pandemic** revealed profound effects on **life expectancy**, especially in high-income countries.
    
- Health outcomes are not just biological—they are shaped by **economic decisions**, resource allocation, and policy.
    
- **Limited resources** + **boundless health needs** = **inevitable trade-offs**, making economics essential in health planning.
    

#### 🧠 **What is Economics?**

> “Economics is the study of how people make choices under the condition of scarcity.”

- **Scarcity** forces people and governments to make **choices** and **sacrifices**.
    
- Health economics focuses on **how health resources are allocated**, and **what outcomes** result from those allocations.
    

#### 🏥 **Why Is Economics Relevant in Health?**

- Health care competes with other sectors (defense, education, etc.) for funding.
    
- **No system can provide unlimited care** → requires **rationing** and **priority-setting**.
    
- Every choice in health (e.g., vaccines, facilities, insurance) has **societal implications**.
    

#### ⚙️ **What Makes Health Care Unique?**

|Feature|Explanation|
|---|---|
|⚠️ Uncertainty|Outcomes and illnesses are unpredictable|
|🧪 Information Gap|Patients rely heavily on experts|
|🌐 Externalities|Health decisions affect others (e.g., herd immunity)|
|🏥 Limited Providers|Often monopolistic, especially in rural areas|

#### 📘 **Definition of Health Economics**

> “The study of how resources are allocated to and within the health economy.”

- Balances **economic logic** with **ethical considerations**.
    
- Evaluates **cost, efficiency, equity, and impact** in health systems.
    

#### 🧠 **Core Learning Goals**

- Develop **economic intuition** to analyze health challenges.
    
- Translate everyday decisions into **policy-level insights**.
    
- Foster **inquisitiveness** and critical thinking.
    

#### 🔍 **Core Concepts Introduced**

##### 1. **Rational Behavior**

- People act to **maximize their utility** (satisfaction or benefit).
    

##### 2. **Cost-Benefit Principle**

- A rational choice is made when:
    
    > ✅ **Benefit ≥ Cost**
    
    - Includes **opportunity cost**: what you give up by choosing something else.
        

##### 3. **Marginal Thinking**

- Decisions are often about **incremental changes**:
    
    > Should we do **one more** of something?
    

#### 🍈 **Case Study: Mr Chan’s Durians**

- Demonstrates **diminishing returns** and marginal analysis.
    
- After a certain point, **extra fertilizer yields fewer durians**.
    
- Optimal input = where **marginal benefit ≥ marginal cost**.
    

#### 📉 **Law of Diminishing Returns**

> “When one input increases while others stay constant, the extra output will eventually decrease.”

- Important in health when evaluating how much **extra funding**, **staff**, or **services** should be added.
    

#### 🧾 **Opportunity Cost in Student Life**

- Example: MPH student incurs:
    
    - Tuition: RM 800
        
    - Living costs: RM 2000
        
    - Lost salary: RM 2000  
        → **Total cost: RM 4800/month**
        
- Rational decision: Pursue MPH only if the **value you gain ≥ RM 4800/month**.
    

#### ✅ **Final Takeaways: Economic Reasoning Tools**

|Concept|Use Case in Health|
|---|---|
|Rational Behavior|Why patients or policymakers choose one option over another|
|Cost-Benefit Analysis|Should we fund dialysis or prevention programmes?|
|Marginal Thinking|Should we vaccinate 1 more child or hire 1 more nurse?|
|Diminishing Returns|When does adding more resources stop being worthwhile?|
|Opportunity Cost|What are we giving up by making a particular choice?|

#### 🎓 **Conclusion**

HE1 equips students with the **economic lens** needed to think critically, make informed decisions, and contribute meaningfully to health systems.  
Health economics is not just about numbers—it’s about **values, trade-offs, and impact**.

_Quantifying impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic through life-expectancy losses: a population-level study of 29 countries._  
Published in the _International Journal of Epidemiology_, 51, 63–74.

---

### 🔎 Key Observations from the Study

- 📉 **Life expectancy at birth declined** between **2019 and 2020** in **27 out of 29 countries** studied.
    
- 👨‍🦳 **Males in the USA and Lithuania** experienced the **largest losses** in life expectancy at birth:
    
    - 🇺🇸 **USA**: **-2.2 years**
        
    - 🇱🇹 **Lithuania**: **-1.7 years**
        
- 📉 Reductions of **more than a full year** in life expectancy at birth were observed in:
    
    - **11 countries for males**
        
    - **8 countries for females**
        
- 🧓 Most of these reductions were **primarily attributed to increased mortality** in those **aged above 60 years**.
    
- ☠️ The deaths were **largely due to COVID-19**, with **official COVID-19 deaths** playing a significant role in the observed declines.
    

---

### 🚨 Historical Significance of the Mortality Surge

- The mortality increases triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 were:
    
    - **Unprecedented in magnitude**, not witnessed since:
        
        - ⚔️ **World War II** in **Western Europe**, or
            
        - ⚒️ The **breakup of the Soviet Union** in **Eastern Europe**.
            
- 📉 By the end of 2020:
    
    - 👩 **Females from 15 countries**, and
        
    - 👨 **Males from 10 countries**  
        ended up with **lower life expectancy at birth** than they had in **2015**.
        

---

### 💡 Implication for Health Economics

The dramatic shifts in life expectancy due to COVID-19 highlight a **crucial intersection between health and economics**:

- The **global shock** to health systems, mortality trends, and national resource allocations emphasizes the **urgency** of understanding:
    
    - How **resources** are distributed within the health sector.
        
    - The **trade-offs** governments face in prioritizing health amidst crises.
        
    - The long-term **economic consequences** of pandemics on human capital and productivity.
        

🔍 **In essence**: Health outcomes are **not isolated** from economic realities—they are profoundly shaped by them. Hence, the field of **Health Economics** becomes **increasingly critical** in informing policy, planning, and investment during and beyond pandemics.

---

## **🧠 Section 2: What is Economics?**

> “**Economics is the study of how people make choices under the condition of scarcity, and of the results of those choices on society.**”  
> — _Frank R. & Bernanke B. (2001). Principles of Economics. McGraw-Hill, Singapore, p.4_

---

### 💡 Understanding the Concept of Scarcity

At the heart of economics lies the **principle of scarcity** — a concept that touches **every aspect** of life, including health.

#### 🔍 What is Scarcity?

> **Scarcity** is a condition in which people **cannot have all** the goods and services they desire.

- It **exists** because:
    
    - Human desires and needs for goods and services are **infinite**,
        
    - But the resources available to produce them are **limited**.
        

---

### ⚖️ Implications of Scarcity

Because of scarcity, we are constantly required to make **decisions** and face **trade-offs**. This leads to:

- **Choices** → We must select which needs or wants to prioritize.
    
- **Sacrifices** → Choosing one option often means **giving up** another.
    

🎯 For example:

- If the government increases funding for public healthcare, it might have to **reduce spending** on defense or infrastructure.
    
- If a person spends RM20 on a movie ticket, they cannot use the same RM20 to buy a meal.
    

---

### 🧭 Why This Matters in Health Economics

In health systems, **scarcity** is particularly critical because:

- Health needs are **endless** – there is always more that could be done to improve health outcomes.
    
- But health resources – including funding, personnel, time, and infrastructure – are **limited**.
    

💬 Therefore, decisions about how to allocate these resources wisely are **inherently economic in nature**.

---

### 📌 Key Takeaway Table

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Scarcity**|A state where resources are not enough to meet all human wants|
|**Choices**|Selection among alternatives due to scarcity|
|**Sacrifices**|What must be forgone when a choice is made (also called opportunity cost)|

---

### 🧠 Final Thoughts

Scarcity is **not just about money**. It's about **time, labor, materials, and even attention**. Every time we say “we can’t do everything,” we’re really saying:

> “We live in a world of scarcity — and that’s why **economics matters**.”

🌟 In the context of public health, this foundational principle becomes the **lens through which we evaluate policy, practice, and planning.**

---

## **🏥 Section 3: Is Economics Relevant in Health?**

Health, unlike other sectors, is often viewed through a **moral**, **emotional**, and **technical** lens. This raises the question:  
**Should economics play a role in healthcare?**

---

### ❓ Debates on the Relevance of Economics in Health

Some argue that **health is too important to be left to economics**. Key contentions include:

#### 1️⃣ Should **patients** make choices?

- Health is often seen as a **technical field** that requires expert understanding.
    
- As such, decision-making is frequently deferred to:
    
    - 👨‍⚕️ **Doctors and professionals**, who are believed to have superior knowledge.
        
- Patients are sometimes perceived as:
    
    - ❗ **Irrational** or **emotionally driven**, making them unfit to make economic or health-related choices.
        

#### 2️⃣ 🧑‍⚕️ **Professional Autonomy**

- Defined as the **freedom of healthcare professionals** to make decisions **without authoritative oversight** from outside the profession.
    
- This raises tension between:
    
    - Clinical expertise and judgment 🧠,
        
    - Versus policy-driven or cost-based decision-making 💰.
        

#### 3️⃣ ⛑️ Is health care a **right**?

- Many assert that **healthcare should be universally accessible**, regardless of cost.
    
- They believe that:
    
    - **Limited resources are not a valid excuse** to deny care.
        
    - Health should **not be left to the market** or influenced by a person’s ability to pay.
        

---

## 💸 Why Economics **IS** Relevant in Health

Despite these concerns, the **real-world landscape** of healthcare **demands economic thinking** for several reasons:

---

### 1️⃣ **Health Consumes National Resources**

Healthcare systems require massive investment, which comes with **opportunity costs**.

- 🧾 Health must compete with other essential sectors such as:
    
    - 🛡️ **Defense**
        
    - 🎓 **Education**
        
    - 🏘️ **Housing**
        
    - 🚆 **Public Transportation**
        

> **Insight**: Resource allocation to health must be balanced against **societal priorities**.

---

### 2️⃣ **Healthcare is a Limited Resource**

- No country, no matter how wealthy, can afford to provide **unlimited high-quality healthcare** to every citizen.
    
- As a result, **rationing is a necessary reality**.
    

📉 **Health Needs = Boundless**  
📈 **Health Resources = Limited**

> This mismatch between supply and demand creates **tension and trade-offs**, which economics is designed to address.

---

### 3️⃣ **Choices Made in Health Have Broader Societal Impacts**

#### 📌 Examples:

|Policy Choice|Economic Impact|
|---|---|
|💉 **Free compulsory immunization**|Generates **herd immunity**, reducing overall societal disease burden|
|🏥 **Public vs. Private Provision**|Affects **equity** and **accessibility** to care|
|🌍 **Healthcare for Migrants**|Influences the **health of the local population**, potential disease spread, and workforce productivity|

---

### 💭 A Provocative Perspective:

> “**Every nation chooses its own death rate by its evaluation of health compared to other goals.**”  
> — _Victor Fuchs, 1974_

📌 This quote underscores the **stark reality**:  
How much a society is willing to **invest in health** reflects how much it values **life itself**.

---

### 🧠 Final Reflection:

Even if healthcare **feels different**—more personal, emotional, and vital—than other sectors, it still **operates within the boundaries of economics**.  
Because resources are limited and choices must be made, **economics is not only relevant but essential** in shaping an equitable, efficient, and sustainable healthcare system.

---

## **🤔 Section 4: What Makes Health Care Unique?**

While economics applies to many sectors—agriculture, manufacturing, education, etc.—**health care stands apart** in several critical ways. These distinctions make the **application of economic principles to health both essential and challenging**.

---

### 🔍 Key Structural Differences in Health Care

Unlike most consumer markets, health care exhibits features that **complicate** economic analysis and **demand tailored tools**.

|💡 **Feature**|🏥 **Health Care Context**|
|---|---|
|⚠️ **Uncertainty**|Both the **occurrence of illness** and the **effectiveness of treatment** are unpredictable. Patients often do not know _if_, _when_, or _how_ they’ll need care.|
|🧪 **Asymmetry of Information**|Medicine is a **highly technical field**. Health professionals possess significantly more knowledge than patients, creating a **knowledge imbalance**.|
|🌐 **Externalities**|Health care decisions affect not just individuals, but entire communities. For example: **vaccinations** promote **herd immunity**, benefiting even those who aren’t vaccinated.|
|🏥 **Provider Monopoly**|In many situations, especially in rural areas or during emergencies, patients have **very limited provider options**. This creates **monopolistic scenarios** where standard market dynamics don’t apply.|

---

### 🔑 Why This Matters

- These unique characteristics **distort the usual assumptions** of a free market:
    
    - Consumers don’t have perfect information.
        
    - Providers may dominate local markets.
        
    - The outcomes are uncertain and sometimes irreversible.
        
    - The ripple effects (externalities) mean that private decisions often have **public consequences**.
        

---

### 🧭 Core Insight

> **Most people value health so highly** that they consider access to health care a **basic human right**, rather than a purchasable good.

💬 In other words:  
Health care is **not just another commodity** to be traded. It is **a fundamental pillar of human dignity**, social equity, and national development.

---

### 🧠 Final Reflection

Because of these complexities, **health care economics must go beyond textbook market models**. It must account for:

- Ethical imperatives 🧭
    
- Social responsibilities 🌍
    
- Biological unpredictability 🧬
    
- Power imbalances between stakeholders ⚖️
    

These factors make the study of health economics **one of the most intellectually rewarding and practically impactful branches** of economic science.

---

## **📘 Section 5: What is Health Economics?**

As health care grows increasingly complex and resource-intensive, **Health Economics emerges as a vital discipline** for understanding, managing, and improving health systems.

---

### 🧠 Definition of Health Economics

> “**Health economics is the study of how resources are allocated to and within the health economy.**”  
> — _Sherman F., Goodman A.C., Stano M. (The Economics of Health and Health Care, 4th Ed., p.1)_

In simpler terms, it asks questions like:

- 💰 **How are health resources—money, personnel, medicines—distributed?**
    
- ⚖️ **Who decides how much to spend on public health vs. private care?**
    
- 🧑‍⚕️ **How do we balance patient needs, professional ethics, and budget constraints?**
    

---

### 💡 What Makes Health Economics Unique?

Health economics combines the rigour of traditional economics with the ethical and practical challenges of health care. It addresses:

- The **allocation** of limited resources in health systems.
    
- The **trade-offs** between cost, access, quality, and outcomes.
    
- The **evaluation** of health interventions, policies, and systems through an economic lens.
    

---

### 📚 Recommended Readings

- Understand **incentives** and **behaviour** of health actors (patients, providers, insurers) 🔍.
    
- Evaluate the **efficiency** and **equity** of health interventions ⚖️.
    
- Inform **resource allocation** that can literally determine who receives care—and who doesn’t 💔.
    

---

### 🧭 Key Takeaway

> Health Economics is **not just about cost-cutting**.  
> It’s about making **better decisions** for **better health**, **fairer access**, and **smarter systems**.

It’s a discipline that asks both:

- **“What is?”** (positive economics), and
    
- **“What should be?”** (normative economics),  
    while always keeping the **human impact** at its heart. ❤️

## **🧠 Section 12: How Do Consumers Make Choices?**

Understanding consumer behaviour is essential in economics—especially in **health economics**, where choices often involve **high stakes**, **limited information**, and **emotional weight**. This section introduces the concept of the **rational person** and how decisions are made through the lens of economic reasoning.

---

### 🧍‍♂️ The Rational Person — _Homo Economicus_

> A **rational person** is someone who has **clearly defined goals** and tries to **fulfil those goals as effectively as possible**.

In economic theory, this idealized figure is known as **_Homo Economicus_** (Latin for "Economic Man").

---

### 🔍 Core Assumptions Behind Rational Economic Behaviour

For a person to behave "rationally" in economic terms, several assumptions are made:

1. **Possession and Use of Knowledge** 📚
    
    - The individual is assumed to **possess the relevant information** needed to make informed choices.
        
2. **Ability to Evaluate Benefits and Costs** ⚖️
    
    - The person can **weigh the pros and cons** of available options with **reasonable certainty**.
        
3. **Maximization of Utility** 🎯
    
    - Within the boundaries of their constraints (like time, income, or health), the rational person aims to:
        
        > **Get the most satisfaction or benefit** out of every decision they make.
        

---

### 💬 What Is Utility?

> **Utility** refers to the **advantage**, **fulfilment**, or **satisfaction** a person derives from consuming a good or service.

- In simpler terms, it’s a way to **quantify happiness or benefit** from an action or decision.
    
- In health economics, utility can be used to:
    
    - Compare the **value of health outcomes**.
        
    - Assess how much individuals are **willing to sacrifice or pay** for better health or longer life.
        

🧁🍪 **Example**:  
Imagine you're choosing between eating a slice of cake or a tin of cookies:

- If the **cake brings you more joy**, it gives you **higher utility**.
    
- A rational person would then choose the cake—unless another constraint (like cost or diet) shifts the decision.
    

---

### 🧠 Why It Matters in Health Economics

In real-world health settings:

- Consumers (patients) make decisions about treatments, screenings, or lifestyle changes.
    
- Policymakers choose between funding hospitals, vaccinations, or health education.
    

Understanding utility and rational choice allows economists to **predict behaviours**, **design better policies**, and **optimize resource use**.

---

### 🧭 Key Takeaways

|🧠 Concept|🔎 Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Rational Person**|An individual who acts deliberately to achieve their goals efficiently.|
|**Knowledge & Comparison**|Rationality assumes people can access and evaluate available options.|
|**Utility**|A measure of satisfaction or benefit from a choice.|
|**Decision Making**|Driven by a desire to **maximize utility** within existing constraints.|

## **🧁 Section 13: Limited Resources – Mei Lee’s Story**

To better understand **scarcity, trade-offs, and opportunity cost**, let’s explore a relatable example involving a character named **Mei Lee**. This simple baking story introduces the powerful concept of the **Production Possibility Curve (PPC)**—a fundamental tool in economics.

---

### 👩‍🍳 Meet Mei Lee

- Mei Lee is preparing for **Chinese New Year celebrations** 🎉.
    
- She plans to **bake homemade treats** for her family and friends.
    
- However, she has a **fixed budget** of **RM 120** 💸.
    
- With that, she can only afford to make **cakes** or **cookies**, but **not both in unlimited quantities**.
    

---

### 📊 The Production Possibility Curve (PPC)

The **Production Possibility Curve (PPC)** visually represents the **trade-offs** Mei Lee faces when choosing how many cakes and tins of cookies to bake with her **limited resources**.

#### 📈 PPC Table: Trade-off Between Cakes and Cookies

|🧁 **Tins of Cookies**|0|2|4|6|8|10|12|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|🎂 **Number of Cakes**|12|10|8|6|4|2|0|

---

### 🎯 Key Insights from Mei Lee’s PPC

1. **Scarcity is Real**:  
    Mei Lee cannot bake **all the cakes and cookies she wants**. Her budget limits her output.
    
2. **Trade-offs are Inevitable**:
    
    - To bake **more cookies**, she must **bake fewer cakes**, and vice versa.
        
    - For instance, choosing to make 8 tins of cookies means she can only make 4 cakes.
        
3. **Choices Reflect Priorities**:
    
    - Mei Lee must consider **what combination** of cakes and cookies brings her the **most satisfaction** (utility), based on her goal for the celebration.
        
4. **The Curve is a Boundary**:
    
    - All combinations on the PPC (e.g., 6 cakes and 6 cookies) are **efficient uses of resources**.
        
    - Anything **inside the curve** (e.g., 4 cakes and 4 cookies) means **resources are underutilized**.
        
    - Anything **outside the curve** (e.g., 10 cakes and 10 cookies) is **not possible** with her current budget.

### 📌 Core Economic Concepts Illustrated by Mei Lee’s Story

|💡 **Concept**|🔎 **Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**Scarcity**|Mei Lee’s RM120 budget forces her to limit her production.|
|**Opportunity Cost**|Making more of one item (cookies) means giving up some of the other (cakes).|
|**Trade-offs**|Mei Lee faces real economic trade-offs due to her resource constraint.|
|**Efficiency**|Points along the PPC represent the most efficient use of her RM120.|

---

### 💬 Why This Matters in Health Economics

Just like Mei Lee’s kitchen dilemma:

- **Health systems** must decide how to allocate limited budgets—e.g., between:
    
    - Vaccines vs. hospital beds
        
    - Staff salaries vs. medical equipment
        
    - Public clinics vs. urban hospitals
        

➡️ These decisions **mirror the PPC trade-offs** and require careful **economic reasoning** to ensure **maximum health benefits** within **finite resources**.

---

## **⚖️ Section 14: Making Rational Decisions**

One of the most powerful ideas in economics is that **every decision involves a cost**. When resources are limited (and they always are), making a choice **automatically implies giving something else up**.

---

### 📌 The Scarcity Principle

Also known as the **“No-Free-Lunch Principle”**, this idea is foundational in economics.

> **Because our wants are unlimited and our resources are limited, choosing more of one good means having less of another.**

📝 This principle applies **universally**—from governments deciding between defence and healthcare, to individuals choosing how to spend time and money.

---

#### 💡 Key Implications:

- **Trade-offs are everywhere**: Every time you say “yes” to something, you are saying “no” to something else.
    
- There is **no such thing as a free choice**—even if no money changes hands, you’re still spending **time, effort, or opportunity**.
    
- Economics doesn’t judge whether a choice is morally good or bad—it simply analyzes how choices are made under **conditions of scarcity**.
    

---

## **📊 Section 15: The Cost-Benefit Principle**

This principle is a **tool for rational decision-making**. It gives us a **simple rule**:

> A rational person should **only pursue an activity if**:  
> ✅ **The Benefits ≥ The Costs**

This concept may sound intuitive, but when applied correctly, it can transform how we approach everyday decisions, public policies, and large-scale investments.

---

### 🔁 Applying It to Your Life

Let’s apply this principle to your current situation as an MPH student:

> 🎓 **“Should I pursue a Master of Public Health degree?”**

Ask yourself:

- What are the **benefits**?
    
    - Gaining knowledge 🧠
        
    - Career advancement 💼
        
    - Networking opportunities 🤝
        
    - Personal fulfillment 🌟
        
- What are the **costs**?
    
    - Tuition fees 💰
        
    - Time commitment ⏳
        
    - Lost income from not working 🧾
        
    - Emotional stress or fatigue 😮‍💨
        

🧠 The rational decision is to pursue the MPH **only if**:

> ✨ **Total benefits of doing the MPH ≥ Total costs (both direct and opportunity costs)**

---

### 🧮 Table: Cost-Benefit Framework for an MPH Student

|💡 **Factor**|✅ **Benefit**|❌ **Cost**|
|---|---|---|
|🎓 Academic knowledge|Gain expertise in public health|Time spent studying|
|💼 Career|Improved job opportunities|Delay in full-time employment|
|💸 Financial|Long-term income increase|Tuition + living costs|
|🧠 Personal growth|New perspectives, confidence|Mental and emotional effort|

---

### 💬 Final Thought

The **Cost-Benefit Principle** helps individuals and institutions:

- Make **clear-headed choices**,
    
- Justify decisions based on **reason, not emotion**, and
    
- Optimize the **use of limited resources** for the greatest possible gain.
    

So whether you're choosing a degree, a policy, or a project—**ask this one essential question**:

> “**Do the benefits outweigh the costs?**”

---

## **💸 Section 16: Student Life Example – What’s Your Cost?**

To understand the **real-world application** of the **cost-benefit principle**, let’s look at a scenario close to home: your life as an MPH student.

Imagine you're trying to evaluate the **true cost** of pursuing your Master of Public Health. This includes more than just tuition fees—it involves **living expenses** and, crucially, your **opportunity cost**.

---

### 🧾 Breakdown of Monthly Costs (Illustrative)

|💼 **Item**|💰 **Estimated Monthly Cost**|
|---|---|
|🎓 Tuition Fees|RM 800|
|🏠 Living Expenses _(rent, food, transport)_|RM 2000|
|💼 Lost Salary _(Opportunity Cost)_|RM 2000|
|**💸 TOTAL**|**RM 4800/month**|

---

### 💡 What Does This Mean?

If you’re choosing to pursue the MPH program, it means you are implicitly saying:

> ✨ “I believe this program is worth **at least RM 4800/month** of value to me.”

Otherwise, from a **rational decision-making perspective**, it wouldn’t make sense to enroll in or continue with the program.

This example helps to reinforce the idea that **every choice carries a cost**—whether you see it upfront or not.

---

## **🔁 Section 17: Opportunity Cost**

Let’s now zoom in on one of the most important—and often overlooked—concepts in economics:

> **Opportunity Cost** = The **value of the next best alternative** that is given up when a choice is made.

---

### 📌 Example in the Student Context

- Suppose you previously held a job with a salary of **RM 2000/month**.
    
- By choosing to study full-time, you’re **forgoing** that income.
    
- That **RM 2000** is not “just gone”—it’s your **opportunity cost**.
    

---

### 🧮 Your Real Cost of Studying MPH

Putting everything together:

|Component|Amount (RM)|
|---|---|
|📚 Tuition Fees|800|
|🏠 Living Expenses|2000|
|💸 Lost Income|2000|
|**TOTAL Cost per Month**|**RM 4800**|

So, even if your tuition is subsidized or seems affordable on the surface, your **total economic cost** is much higher when you include the **value of what you’re giving up** (in this case, a monthly salary).

---

## **🧾 Section 18: Who Pays?**

From the perspective of a public accountant or policymaker, the question isn’t just “what does it cost you?”—but also, “who contributes to this cost?”

This distinction is important because **health economics also evaluates funding sources and financial burdens across society**.

---

### 📊 Financial Contribution Breakdown (Illustrative)

|🧾 **Contributor**|💵 **Monthly Value**|
|---|---|
|🎓 **Student (You)**|RM 2800|
|🏛️ **Government Subsidy**|RM 1000|
|💰 **TOTAL**|**RM 3800/month**|

> _Note: These values are for illustration only and do not represent actual figures from the university._

---

### 💬 Why This Matters

Understanding **who pays** and **how much** reveals:

- The **investment required** to train public health professionals like yourself,
    
- The **shared responsibility** between the individual and the state,
    
- And the **hidden costs** that often go unaccounted for in decision-making.
    

It also helps in evaluating **public return on investment (ROI)**—a key theme in **health policy** and **health economics**.

---

### 🧠 Summary of Sections 16–18

|🧠 Concept|💬 Key Takeaway|
|---|---|
|**Total Cost of MPH**|More than just tuition—it includes living costs and opportunity cost.|
|**Opportunity Cost**|The value of the best alternative you gave up (e.g., lost salary).|
|**Who Pays?**|Both students and the government share the financial burden of education.|

---

## **🔍 Section 19: Are All Costs & Benefits Equal?**

In economics—and especially in health economics—**not all decisions are black and white**. They're not always about doing **everything or nothing**. Often, decisions fall somewhere in between.

---

### ❓ All-or-None? Not Quite.

Real-world decisions are usually **incremental**.

We often make **small adjustments**, such as:

- 🧁 **Bake 3 cakes instead of 5**, if ingredients or time are limited.
    
- 🍞 **Eat 2 slices of bread** instead of 1—because you're a bit hungrier today.
    
- 🏥 **Build 1 more hospital**, rather than funding an entire healthcare overhaul.
    

> These are examples of **“partial” choices**, where we adjust **quantities** instead of going all-in or opting out.

---

### 💬 Why This Matters

Health policymakers don't just ask:

> “Should we build a hospital?”  
> They ask:  
> “Should we build **one more** hospital?”  
> “Should we train **10 or 50** more nurses?”  
> “Should we increase funding for dialysis by **RM 2 million or RM 10 million**?”

This is where **marginal thinking** becomes essential.

---

## **📈 Section 20: Marginal Analysis**

Marginal analysis is one of the most **powerful tools** in economics. It helps decision-makers think in terms of **incremental changes**, rather than extreme choices.

---

### 💡 Key Concepts and Definitions

|📊 **Term**|📘 **Meaning**|
|---|---|
|**Marginal Benefit (MB)**|The **additional benefit** gained from **one more unit** of a good, service, or activity.|
|**Marginal Cost (MC)**|The **additional cost** incurred from **one more unit** of a good, service, or activity.|

---

### 🧠 Why Marginal Thinking Is Powerful

> Most decisions are not “yes” or “no.”  
> They’re “**how much more** should we do?”

This applies to health economics in various ways:

- 💉 **Should we vaccinate 1 more child?**
    
- 🚑 **Should we extend ambulance service hours by 2 more hours per day?**
    
- 🧪 **Should we run one more diagnostic test?**
    

Economics tells us:

> ✅ Keep doing more **as long as** the **Marginal Benefit (MB) ≥ Marginal Cost (MC)**.

---

### 📌 Key Takeaway Table

|🧠 **Concept**|💬 **Real-Life Application**|
|---|---|
|**Marginal Benefit (MB)**|The value of **each additional patient treated**, each **extra vaccine administered**, etc.|
|**Marginal Cost (MC)**|The cost of **one more nurse**, **one more bed**, **one more clinic hour**, etc.|
|**Decision Rule**|If MB ≥ MC → ✅ Go ahead!If MB < MC → ❌ Stop!|

---

### 🧭 Final Reflection

Marginal analysis helps prevent **overuse** of resources and ensures we don’t **underinvest** when benefits still outweigh the costs.

Whether you're deciding how much to eat 🍽️, how long to study 📖, or how many ICU beds to fund 🏥, the **marginal mindset** helps guide **rational and efficient decision-making**.

---

## **🌳 Section 21: Case Study – Mr Chan’s Durians 🍈**

This case study applies **marginal analysis** to a familiar and delicious context—**durian farming**. Meet Mr Chan, a durian grower who must decide how much fertilizer to apply to his trees to maximize profit.

This scenario illustrates the **law of diminishing returns**, **marginal cost-benefit comparison**, and **optimal decision-making** in economics.

---

### 🧑‍🌾 Meet Mr Chan

- Mr Chan owns a durian farm and wants to increase his harvest.
    
- He decides to use **fertilizer** to boost productivity.
    
- However, **fertilizer costs money**, and more fertilizer doesn’t always mean **proportionally more durians**.
    
- His goal: **Maximize profit**, not just output.
    

---

### 📦 Productivity Table: Fertilizer vs. Durian Output

|🌾 **Fertilizer (kg)**|🍈 **Total Durians (kg)**|➕ **Additional Durians (kg)**|
|---|---|---|
|0|100|–|
|1|120|20|
|2|128|8|
|3|132|4|
|4|135|3|
|5|137|2|
|6|138|1|

---

### 📊 Key Insight: Diminishing Returns

- At first, applying fertilizer **greatly increases output** (e.g., from 0 to 1 kg → +20 durians).
    
- But as more fertilizer is added, the **additional output shrinks**:
    
    - 2nd kg → only +8 durians,
        
    - 3rd kg → +4 durians,
        
    - 6th kg → just +1 durian.
        

🎯 **This demonstrates the "Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns"**—each additional unit of input yields **less additional output**.

---

### 💰 Cost-Benefit Table: Is It Worth It?

Let’s now evaluate whether it makes **economic sense** to add more fertilizer by comparing the **marginal cost** and **marginal benefit** at each stage.

|🌾 **Fertilizer (kg)**|💸 **Cost (RM)**|🍈 **Total Durians (kg)**|➕ **Extra Durians**|💵 **Income (RM)**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|–|100|–|–|
|1|RM 8|120|20|RM 100|
|2|RM 8|128|8|RM 40|
|3|RM 8|132|4|RM 20|
|4|RM 8|135|3|RM 15|
|5|RM 8|137|2|RM 10|
|6|RM 8|138|1|RM 5|

📌 Assumptions:

- Fertilizer costs **RM 8 per kg** 💰
    
- Durians sell for **RM 5 per kg** 🍈
    

---

### ✅ Decision Rule Based on Marginal Analysis

- For each **additional kg of fertilizer**, calculate:
    
    - **Marginal Cost (MC)** = RM 8
        
    - **Marginal Benefit (MB)** = Income from extra durians
        

💡 Mr Chan should **continue applying fertilizer** **as long as**:

> **Marginal Benefit (MB) ≥ Marginal Cost (MC)**

---

### ❗ Conclusion

- At **5 kg of fertilizer**, Mr Chan earns **RM 10**, which still exceeds the cost (**RM 8**).
    
- At **6 kg**, the benefit drops to **RM 5**, which is **less than the cost**.
    

👉 Therefore:

> ✅ **Mr Chan should stop at 5 kg of fertilizer.**  
> Beyond that, **the cost outweighs the benefit**, and he would be **losing money**.

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts Reinforced

|🧩 Concept|💬 Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Diminishing Returns**|Additional input yields smaller additional output after a certain point.|
|**Marginal Benefit (MB)**|Extra income earned from applying one more kg of fertilizer.|
|**Marginal Cost (MC)**|Additional expense of buying one more kg of fertilizer (RM 8).|
|**Optimal Decision Point**|Stop increasing input when MB < MC. In this case, that’s after 5 kg.|

---

## **📉 Section 22: The Law of Diminishing Returns**

In economics—particularly in **production and resource allocation**—one of the most important principles is the **Law of Diminishing Returns**. It helps explain why **adding more of a single input doesn’t always lead to proportional increases in output**.

---

### 📜 Definition

> **“When you keep increasing one input while holding all other inputs constant, the additional output gained from each extra unit of input will eventually decline.”**

This is also known as the **principle of diminishing marginal returns**.

---

### 🍈 Real-World Example: Mr Chan’s Durians (Revisited)

Let’s recall Mr Chan, our durian farmer from Section 21.

- When he added **1 kg of fertilizer**, he gained **20 kg of durians**.
    
- But by the time he added the **6th kg**, he only gained **1 kg of durians**.
    

|🌾 **Fertilizer (kg)**|➕ **Extra Durians (kg)**|
|---|---|
|1|20|
|2|8|
|3|4|
|4|3|
|5|2|
|6|1|

---

### 📊 Visual Insight: What the Curve Looks Like

Imagine a graph where:

- The **x-axis** represents **Fertilizer (kg)**.
    
- The **y-axis** represents **Total Durians (kg)**.
    

As you move right along the x-axis (adding more fertilizer):

- The curve **rises quickly at first**, reflecting large initial gains.
    
- Then it begins to **flatten**, showing that **each extra kg** gives **less additional output**.
    

📈 _This is the classic shape of a **diminishing returns curve**._

---

### ⚠️ Why This Matters in Health Economics

The law of diminishing returns doesn’t just apply to agriculture—it’s everywhere in health:

- 💉 Giving more doses of a vaccine might have huge benefits initially, but each additional dose (after full coverage) offers **less impact**.
    
- 🏥 Building more clinics in an already well-served area might yield **lower incremental benefits** than in underserved regions.
    
- 👨‍⚕️ Hiring more staff can improve care, but at some point, **overstaffing** might add little value while raising costs.
    

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaway

|💡 **Concept**|🔍 **Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**Law of Diminishing Returns**|After a certain point, adding more of one input (while holding others constant) yields smaller additional outputs.|
|**Why It Happens**|Other resources (like space, time, or tools) become **limiting factors**.|
|**Implication for Decision-Making**|Helps identify the **optimal point** of input use—where **marginal benefit starts to fall below marginal cost**.|

---

Understanding this law is **crucial for efficient resource use**, especially in health systems where funding, time, and manpower are limited.

---

## **📌 Section 23: Recap & Key Takeaways**

As we wrap up HE1, it’s important to consolidate the core principles of **economic reasoning**—the analytical lens through which health economists approach problems, policies, and priorities.

Whether you’re making a clinical decision, designing a health policy, or evaluating a health intervention, these tools are **foundational to thinking like a health economist**.

---

### 👨‍🏫 Economic Reasoning Involves Three Fundamental Ideas:

---

#### 1️⃣ **Rational Behavior** 🧠

- Assumes that individuals:
    
    - Have **well-defined goals**.
        
    - Strive to **maximize their utility** (i.e., satisfaction, benefit, or well-being).
        
- In health economics:
    
    - Patients make choices that they believe will improve their health.
        
    - Policymakers aim to achieve the **best health outcomes** within a budget.
        

> 📌 Even if decisions seem irrational at times, economics assumes that people are doing their best within their **information and constraints**.

---

#### 2️⃣ **Cost-Benefit Analysis** ⚖️

- A rational person evaluates whether:
    
    > ✅ **Benefit ≥ Cost**
    
- This includes **all types of costs**:
    
    - **Direct costs**: money, time, effort.
        
    - **Opportunity costs**: what you’re giving up by choosing one thing over another.
        
- In health:
    
    - Should we spend on screening or treatment?
        
    - Should we allocate funds to rural clinics or urban hospitals?
        
    - Should a patient undergo surgery or manage with medication?
        

> 💡 The **cost-benefit principle** helps justify whether an action, policy, or intervention is **economically sound**.

---

#### 3️⃣ **Marginal Thinking** ➕

- Most decisions aren’t “all or nothing.”
    
- Instead, they involve:
    
    > “Should we do a **little more or a little less** of something?”
    
- Key concepts:
    
    - **Marginal Benefit (MB)** = extra gain from one more unit.
        
    - **Marginal Cost (MC)** = extra cost of one more unit.
        

|🔄 Decision Rule|✅ Proceed if:|
|---|---|
|**Marginal Analysis**|**MB ≥ MC**|

📍 Example:

- Vaccinate one more child?
    
- Open one more clinic in a remote district?
    
- Train five more nurses?
    

> These are **incremental choices**, where marginal analysis helps **fine-tune decision-making**.

---

### 🧠 Final Thought: Economic Reasoning Is Everywhere

|🔍 Principle|💬 Real-World Reflection|
|---|---|
|**Rational Behavior**|Why patients skip expensive treatments despite recommendations.|
|**Cost-Benefit Analysis**|Why governments subsidize vaccines but not aesthetic surgery.|
|**Marginal Thinking**|Why adding one more ambulance to an over-served area may not help.|

---

### 🎓 What This Means for You as a Health Professional

By applying economic reasoning:

- You’ll be able to **justify decisions** clearly and logically.
    
- You’ll learn to **make the best use of limited resources**.
    
- You’ll think critically about both **individual choices** and **system-level trade-offs**.
    

✨ Whether you're planning a national health program or simply deciding how to spend your own time and money—the tools of economics will **sharpen your strategy**.

---
