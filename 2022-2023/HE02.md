👩🏻‍🏫 _Prof. Ng Chiu Wan_  
🗓️ Lecture Date: 26 October 2022  
📚 Module: MQB7014 – Health Economics

---

## 🧾 **Executive Summary**

### 🎯 **Objective of the Lecture**

To introduce and explain the **fundamental economic tools and concepts** that underpin decision-making in health economics—providing students with a clear foundation to analyze supply, demand, pricing, and market behavior in the healthcare context.

### 🔑 **Key Concepts Covered**

#### 1️⃣ **Rational Decision-Making & Marginal Analysis**

- Individuals aim to **maximize utility** given **scarce resources**
    
- Decisions are made based on **marginal cost-benefit analysis**, a principle central to economic evaluation in health
    

#### 2️⃣ **Measurement of Utility & Value**

- Utility, though not directly measurable, is **reflected in willingness to pay**
    
- The **Diamond-Water Paradox** highlights how **scarcity and marginal utility**, not essentiality, determine price
    

#### 3️⃣ **Demand Dynamics**

- **Law of Demand**: Price ↑ → Quantity demanded ↓ (inverse relationship)
    
- **Demand function** influenced by price, income, preferences, and prices of related goods
    
- **Shifts vs. Movements**: Changes in determinants shift the demand curve, while price changes cause movement along it
    

#### 4️⃣ **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**

- PED quantifies responsiveness to price changes:
    
    - **Elastic**: PED > 1
        
    - **Inelastic**: PED < 1
        
    - **Unit Elastic**: PED = 1
        
- Key applications in healthcare include **cost-sharing impacts** and **policy implications**
    

#### 5️⃣ **Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED)**

- Measures how the demand for one good changes in response to the price change of another:
    
    - **Positive CED** → Substitutes
        
    - **Negative CED** → Complements
        
    - **Zero CED** → Independents
        

#### 6️⃣ **Health Sector Case Studies**

- Examples include the **RAND Health Insurance Experiment** and healthcare usage in **Burkina Faso**
    
- Highlight the danger of interpreting low responsiveness as a license to raise prices in poor or underserved areas
    

#### 7️⃣ **Supply Dynamics**

- **Law of Supply**: Price ↑ → Quantity supplied ↑
    
- **Supply function** responds to price, cost of production, and technology
    
- **Shifts in supply** result from cost/tech changes and impact equilibrium
    

#### 8️⃣ **Market Equilibrium**

- Occurs when **quantity demanded = quantity supplied**
    
- Prices adjust naturally to eliminate **surpluses and shortages**
    

#### 9️⃣ **Market Structures**

- Types: Monopoly, Oligopoly, Monopolistic Competition, Perfect Competition, Monopsony
    
- **Perfect Competition** is ideal for efficiency but rarely exists in healthcare
    

#### 🔟 **Relevance to Health Economics**

- Economic tools help diagnose **inefficiencies**, justify **policy interventions**, and support **resource allocation decisions**
    
- Markets in health behave differently due to **information asymmetry**, **externalities**, and **equity concerns**
    

### 📌 **Conclusion**

This lecture equips students with **core economic principles** necessary to navigate and influence real-world healthcare systems. By understanding supply and demand, market behavior, and elasticity, MPH graduates are better prepared to:

- Analyze healthcare utilization patterns
    
- Predict impacts of pricing and subsidy policies
    
- Advocate for equitable and efficient health resource allocation
    

> 💡 **Bottom Line**: Economic thinking is not just about money—it's about making smarter, fairer decisions in a world of trade-offs.

### 🔁 **Revision Recap – Core Concepts in Economic Thinking**

#### 🧠 **1. The Rational Person**

A foundational concept in economics is the idea of the **"rational person"**—a theoretical individual whose decisions are guided by logical reasoning aimed at maximizing personal benefit or satisfaction.

##### ✅ Key Traits of a Rational Person:

- **Maximizes Utility (Satisfaction)**
    
    - Every decision is made to gain the **highest possible satisfaction** or benefit from available choices.
        
    - This utility can be in the form of **happiness, health, financial gains**, or other personal goals.
        
- **Acts Within Conditions of Scarcity**
    
    - Recognizes that **resources are limited**—including time, money, energy, and goods.
        
    - Therefore, rational individuals must make **choices** on how to allocate those resources.
        

📌 _This principle underlies consumer choices, policymaking, and even how health services are delivered or accessed._

#### ⚖️ **2. Rational Decision-Making**

In economics, making decisions is not about emotion—it's about logic, comparison, and trade-offs.

##### ✅ Core Principle:

> A rational decision is made by **balancing the costs and benefits** of each option.

🔹 Individuals compare:

- What they **gain** from a decision (benefits)
    
- Against what they **give up** (costs—whether monetary or opportunity-based)
    

💡 _This applies to patients choosing between treatments, governments allocating healthcare budgets, or individuals deciding whether to seek care._

#### ✨ **3. Marginal Analysis**

Marginal analysis is a **critical tool** in economic thinking and especially relevant in health economics.

##### ✅ Key Idea:

> What matters most is not the **total** cost or benefit, but the **additional (marginal)** cost or benefit from **one more unit** of something.

🧮 **Marginal = Incremental**

- For example, what is the **extra benefit** of conducting **one more diagnostic test**?
    
- Or the **added cost** of treating **one more patient** with a specific drug?
    

#### 🩺 In Health Economics:

- **Marginal analysis** is essential in **economic evaluations** such as:
    
    - **Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)**
        
    - **Cost-utility analysis (CUA)**
        
    - **Cost-benefit analysis (CBA)**
        

These tools help determine whether the **next ringgit** or **next dose of treatment** gives a worthwhile return.

#### 📌 Summary Table – Revision Concepts

|Concept|Description|Application Example in Health Economics|
|---|---|---|
|**Rational Person**|Makes decisions to maximize satisfaction within limited resources|Patients choosing treatments they believe are most effective|
|**Rational Decision-Making**|Weighs benefits against costs in each decision|Ministry choosing between two national health programs|
|**Marginal Analysis**|Considers incremental cost/benefit of "one more unit"|Evaluating the benefit of extending a screening program|

#### 🧠 Key Takeaway:

> **Economics is about choices.**  
> Every rational actor—be it a patient, provider, or policymaker—must navigate **trade-offs**, making decisions by carefully considering **scarcity**, **costs**, **benefits**, and **what’s gained from just a little more**.

### 📏 **Measurement of Utility**


#### 🎯 **What is Utility?**

In economics, **utility** refers to the **level of satisfaction or value** that a person derives from consuming a good or service.

> 💡 **Utility = Perceived Benefit or Satisfaction**

It’s a **core concept** in understanding individual decision-making, especially in health economics, where utility can relate to **health outcomes, quality of life**, or **personal preferences** for different treatments or services.

#### 📐 **But how do we _measure_ utility?**

##### 📌 Two possible approaches:

|Approach|Description|
|---|---|
|**Utils** 🧪|A theoretical unit used to represent **satisfaction** (not used practically)|
|**Money** 💰|A real-world proxy for utility—**how much someone is willing to pay**|

#### 💸 **Price as a Proxy for Utility**

The lecture highlights a **practical insight**:

> 🧠 _"The price we pay for a good or service reflects the amount of satisfaction or value we obtain from consuming that good or service."_

This means:

- If someone pays more for a product, they likely **value it more**.
    
- In health economics, **willingness to pay (WTP)** becomes a **measurable expression of utility**.
    

📍 _Example in healthcare_:  
Someone may be willing to pay more for a **private clinic** over a **public hospital** due to perceived benefits like:

- Shorter waiting times
    
- Better amenities
    
- Higher confidence in care
    

#### 💎💧 **Illustrative Concept: The Diamond-Water Paradox**

Classic economic paradox that relates directly to utility measurement:

|**Item**|**Essential for Life?**|**Price**|**Why?**|
|---|---|---|---|
|💧 **Water**|Yes ✅|Low 💸|Abundant, hence marginal utility is low|
|💎 **Diamonds**|No ❌|High 💰|Scarce, hence high marginal utility|

This paradox demonstrates that **price doesn’t necessarily reflect absolute value or importance**, but rather the **marginal utility** derived from consuming an additional unit.

#### 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **Utility** = Satisfaction derived from consuming a good/service.
    
- While **"utils"** are conceptual, **money** (especially willingness to pay) is a practical tool for utility measurement.
    
- The **price someone pays** often reflects their **perceived value or satisfaction**.
    
- In health economics, utility measurement is fundamental in:
    
    - **Economic evaluations** (e.g., cost-utility analysis)
        
    - **Policy decisions** (e.g., pricing strategies, subsidy allocation)

### 💎💧 **The Diamond-Water Paradox**

#### 🧠 **What is the Diamond-Water Paradox?**

The **Diamond-Water Paradox** is a classic concept in economics that challenges our everyday assumptions about **value and price**.

It poses a curious observation:

> 💧 **Water**, which is essential for life, is typically cheap.  
> 💎 **Diamonds**, which are not essential, are extremely expensive.


#### ❓ **Why does this paradox matter in economics?**

Because it illustrates the **difference between**:

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Total Utility** 💼|The overall value or satisfaction derived from consuming a good|
|**Marginal Utility** ➕|The **additional** satisfaction gained from consuming **one more unit**|

#### 🔍 **Breaking Down the Paradox**

|Good|Essential?|Abundant?|Marginal Utility|Price|Why?|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|💧 Water|Yes ✅|Yes ✅|Low|Low 💸|So abundant that each additional unit has little added value|
|💎 Diamond|No ❌|No ❌|High|High 💰|Very scarce; each additional unit is perceived as highly valuable|

##### 🔁 In summary:

- **Water has high total utility** but **low marginal utility** → 💸 Low price
    
- **Diamonds have low total utility** but **high marginal utility** → 💰 High price
    

#### 📈 **Economic Insight**

This paradox helps economists explain that:

> **Price is determined not by how essential something is, but by how scarce it is and how much marginal utility it provides.**

🔹 In a world of **scarce resources**, it's **marginal utility**—not intrinsic importance—that **drives price**.

#### 🩺 **Implications for Health Economics**

Understanding this paradox is important in healthcare settings too:

- Some **life-saving interventions** (like clean water or vaccinations) may be underpriced or undervalued because of their **abundance or low marginal utility per unit**.
    
- Meanwhile, **rare treatments or breakthrough drugs** might command high prices, not necessarily due to greater life-saving potential, but due to **scarcity, cost of development**, and **perceived value**.
    

#### 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **Value ≠ Importance.** Just because something is **essential** doesn’t mean it will have a **high price**.
    
- Prices reflect **scarcity** and **marginal utility**, not moral or survival importance.
    
- This distinction is foundational in understanding market behavior, policy prioritization, and health resource allocation.

## 📊 **Demand & Supply Basics**

---

### 📈 **Understanding Demand**

#### 🧍‍♀️ **What Is Demand? – The Customer’s Perspective**

At its core, **demand** refers to the quantity of a good or service that **consumers are both willing and able to purchase** over a specific period of time.

> ✅ **Willingness** = The desire to buy something  
> ✅ **Ability** = The financial means or capacity to buy it

A person may **want** a luxury item like a high-end treatment or branded medication, but **demand** only exists if they can **also afford** it.

#### 🎯 **Determinants of Demand**

While **price** is the primary factor affecting demand, it's not the only one. A wide range of factors can shift or influence how much people are willing and able to buy:

##### 🔑 Key Determinants:

1. 💰 **Price of the Product (P)**
    
    - The **most direct** influence.
        
    - When price goes **up**, demand tends to go **down**, and vice versa.
        
2. 🧾 **Income (Y)**
    
    - Higher income often leads to increased demand for **normal goods**.
        
    - For some goods (called **inferior goods**), demand might decrease as income rises.
        
3. ❤️ **Tastes and Preferences (T)**
    
    - Shaped by culture, trends, awareness, health beliefs, etc.
        
    - For example, increased awareness about sugar may reduce demand for soft drinks.
        
4. 🔄 **Prices of Related Goods (RP)**
    
    - Includes:
        
        - **Substitutes** (e.g., coffee vs. tea)
            
        - **Complements** (e.g., syringes and insulin)
            
    - A change in price of a related good can affect demand **even if the product’s own price stays the same**.
        

#### 📊 **Example: Ice Cream Cone Demand Schedule**

This table shows how the **quantity demanded** of ice cream cones changes as the **price per cone** increases:

|💸 **Price per Cone (RM)**|🍦 **Quantity Demanded**|
|---|---|
|0.00|120 cones|
|0.50|100 cones|
|1.00|80 cones|
|1.50|60 cones|
|2.00|40 cones|
|2.50|20 cones|
|3.00|0 cones|

🧠 _This table reflects a common economic pattern: as price increases, demand decreases._

#### 📉 **The Demand Curve**

The data above can be visualized using a **demand curve**, which typically has the following features:

- 📉 **Downward-Sloping Curve** from left to right  
    → Reflects the **inverse relationship** between price and quantity demanded.
    
- **Axes**:
    
    - 📍 Horizontal axis = Quantity of ice cream cones
        
    - 📍 Vertical axis = Price per cone
        

#### 📌 **What the Curve Tells Us**

- When **price is RM0.00**, demand is **120 cones**.
    
- As price increases to **RM3.00**, demand drops to **0 cones**.
    
- This curve visualizes the **Law of Demand**:
    
    > **As price rises, quantity demanded falls (ceteris paribus – all else equal).**
    

#### 📚 Healthcare Application

Understanding demand is crucial in **health economics**:

- 📈 What happens when the price of outpatient consultation rises?
    
- 💊 How does a subsidy for essential medication impact demand?
    
- 🧑‍⚕️ Will increasing the cost of preventive screenings reduce uptake?
    

Knowing how consumers **respond to changes in price and other factors** helps public health planners and policymakers:

- Design **effective interventions**
    
- Improve **service delivery**
    
- Allocate **resources efficiently**

### 📜 **Law of Demand**

#### ⚖️ **Definition of the Law**

The **Law of Demand** is one of the most fundamental principles in economics. It describes the **inverse relationship** between the **price** of a good or service and the **quantity demanded** by consumers.

> 📌 **Ceteris paribus** (Latin for _all other things being equal_):  
> The law holds true only when other influencing factors (like income, preferences, etc.) remain unchanged.

#### 🔁 **Core Statement**

> **When the price of a product rises**, the **quantity demanded falls**,  
> and  
> **when the price falls**, the **quantity demanded rises**.

#### 📉 Why Does Demand Respond This Way?

Several underlying reasons explain this natural economic behavior:

##### ✅ 1. **Substitution Effect** 🔄

- As the price of a product increases, **consumers may switch** to a cheaper substitute.
    
- E.g., If the price of a private clinic visit rises, patients may opt for public clinics.
    

##### ✅ 2. **Income Effect** 💸

- A higher price effectively **reduces consumers’ purchasing power**.
    
- With the same income, they can afford **less** of the more expensive item.
    

##### ✅ 3. **Diminishing Marginal Utility** 📉

- As consumers buy **more units** of a good, each additional unit offers **less satisfaction**.
    
- They’re only willing to buy more if the **price drops** accordingly.
    

#### 📊 Visualizing the Law of Demand

On a **demand curve**:

- The **vertical axis** (Y-axis) represents **price**
    
- The **horizontal axis** (X-axis) represents **quantity demanded**
    

The curve **slopes downward** from left to right ⬇️➡️  
→ This reflects the law: as **price decreases**, **quantity demanded increases**.

#### 🩺 Health Economics Application

The Law of Demand is **especially relevant** when evaluating healthcare access, affordability, and pricing:

- 💊 Raising the price of medications may reduce demand—even when those drugs are essential.
    
- 🧪 Lowering the cost of screening services can increase participation and early detection rates.
    
- 👨‍⚕️ Demand for elective procedures may fluctuate based on out-of-pocket costs.
    

📌 _Hence, price-setting in healthcare must consider both equity and behavioral response._

#### 🧠 Key Takeaways

|Element|Description|
|---|---|
|**Law of Demand**|When price ↑ → quantity demanded ↓ (and vice versa)|
|**Ceteris Paribus**|Assumes other factors remain constant|
|**Main Drivers**|Substitution effect, income effect, diminishing marginal utility|
|**Real-World Relevance**|Used in pricing decisions, health subsidy policies, and insurance design|

---

### 🔧 **Demand Function – What Determines Demand?**

#### 📌 **What Is a Demand Function?**

While the **Law of Demand** emphasizes the inverse relationship between **price** and **quantity demanded**, real-world demand is influenced by **many other factors** beyond price alone.

> 💡 A **demand function** expresses the relationship between the **quantity demanded** of a product and the **multiple factors** that influence it.

#### 🧮 **Mathematical Expression**

Qd=f(P,RP,Y,T…)Q_d = f(P, RP, Y, T…)

Where:

- `Qd` = Quantity of the product demanded
    
- `f` = Function (i.e., depends on...)
    
- `P` = **Price** of the good
    
- `RP` = **Prices of related products**
    
- `Y` = **Income** of the consumer
    
- `T` = **Tastes and preferences**
    
- `…` = Other influencing factors (e.g. population, expectations, marketing)
    

#### 🔍 **Explanation of Each Variable**

|Symbol|Variable|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Qd**|Quantity Demanded|The total amount of the good consumers are willing and able to purchase|
|**P**|Price|The market price of the good itself—**main determinant** in most scenarios|
|**RP**|Related Prices|Includes prices of **substitute** and **complementary** goods|
|**Y**|Income|Consumer’s purchasing power—affects demand for **normal** and **inferior** goods|
|**T**|Tastes & Preferences|Cultural, social, psychological, and individual factors that influence desirability|

#### 📊 **Understanding the Dynamics with Examples**

##### ✅ 1. **Price of the Good (P)**

- 🧊 If the price of ice cream increases → demand for ice cream **falls**
    
- Core principle of the **law of demand**
    

##### ✅ 2. **Prices of Related Goods (RP)**

- 🍰 If the price of **cake** drops → people may buy **less ice cream** (substitute effect)
    
- 🥤 If the price of **cones** increases → people may also buy **less ice cream** (complement effect)
    

##### ✅ 3. **Income (Y)**

- 🧍‍♂️ For **normal goods**: more income → more demand
    
- 🍜 For **inferior goods** (e.g., instant noodles): more income → **less** demand
    

##### ✅ 4. **Tastes and Preferences (T)**

- 🍦 If health trends encourage low-sugar diets → demand for ice cream **declines**
    
- 💡 Influenced by advertising, culture, education, peer influence
    

#### 🩺 **Relevance to Health Economics**

In healthcare, **demand is rarely influenced by price alone**. Other critical demand determinants include:

- 📈 **Health awareness and literacy** (affecting T)
    
- 💊 **Availability of generic drugs** (affecting RP)
    
- 💸 **Subsidies or insurance coverage** (affecting P and Y)
    
- 🧍‍♀️ **Population health needs and epidemiology** (affecting Qd)
    

Understanding this **multivariable nature** is essential when designing:

- Demand-side interventions (e.g., subsidies, awareness campaigns)
    
- Economic evaluations (e.g., willingness-to-pay studies)
    
- Health policies (e.g., universal coverage or sin tax planning)
    

#### 🧠 **Key Takeaways**

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Demand Function**|A formula that reflects how demand is influenced by multiple variables|
|**Qd = f(P, RP, Y, T)**|Shows how price, income, preferences, and related goods impact demand|
|**Health Economics Use**|Helps anticipate service utilization and optimize policy design|

### 🔄 **Movements vs Shifts in Demand**

Understanding how demand responds to various influences is **crucial** in economics. While the **demand curve** itself captures the general relationship between **price and quantity demanded**, we must distinguish between:

 🌀 1. **Movement Along the Demand Curve**
 vs
 🔁 2. **Shift of the Demand Curve**

#### 🌀 **1. Movement Along the Demand Curve**

This refers to a **change in the quantity demanded** **caused by a change in the price** of the good or service **itself**, assuming all other factors remain constant (_ceteris paribus_).

##### 📌 Key Characteristics:

- **The curve does NOT shift**; instead, we **move along the existing curve**.
    
- It represents a change in **how much people buy due to a new price**.
    

##### 📈 Example:

> If the price of an ice cream cone increases from **RM1.50 to RM2.00**, the quantity demanded **falls** from 60 cones to 40 cones.

This is a **movement upward along the demand curve** (from a higher quantity to a lower quantity due to a price rise).

##### 📉 Conversely:

> If price decreases from **RM2.00 to RM1.50**, quantity demanded **increases**—a **movement downward along the demand curve**.

#### 🔁 **2. Shift of the Demand Curve**

This refers to a change in **demand due to factors other than the good's price**. When these factors change, the **entire demand curve moves**, indicating people are willing to buy **more or less at every price point**.

##### 📌 Key Characteristics:

- **The curve itself shifts**—either **rightward** (increase in demand) or **leftward** (decrease in demand).
    
- Caused by **changes in determinants** of demand other than the price of the good.
    

#### 📊 Examples of Demand Shifts

|Scenario|Direction of Shift|Why?|
|---|---|---|
|🎉 **Income Increases** → People can afford more ice cream|👉 Right Shift ⏩|More purchasing power = Higher demand|
|🍫 **Price of a related good (e.g., chocolates) drops**|👈 Left Shift ⏪|Consumers switch to cheaper substitutes|

##### 🧠 Visual Intuition:

- A **right shift** ⏩ = At every price, **more** quantity is demanded.
    
- A **left shift** ⏪ = At every price, **less** quantity is demanded.
    

#### 🧮 Graphical Summary

|Type|What Changes?|Caused By|Curve Behavior|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Movement along curve**|Quantity demanded|**Change in price of the good**|Stay on same curve|
|**Shift of demand curve**|Demand itself|**Change in income, preferences, related goods, etc.**|Curve moves left/right|

#### 🩺 Health Economics Application

This distinction is **critical** in public health decision-making:

- 💸 If a **drug price increases**, and demand drops → **movement along the curve**.
    
- 🧾 If **insurance coverage expands**, making the drug free → **shift to the right** in demand.
    
- 🧠 If public health campaigns reduce interest in sugary drinks → **shift to the left** in demand.
    

Policy interventions are often aimed at **shifting demand curves**, not just adjusting prices.

#### ✅ Key Takeaways

- A **movement** along the demand curve reflects a **price change** of the product.
    
- A **shift** in the demand curve reflects a change in **external factors** affecting demand.
    
- Being able to **differentiate** these is essential for analyzing behavior in health systems and designing effective interventions.

### 🧪 **Rand Health Insurance Experiment (HIE)**


#### 🧬 **What Was the RAND Health Insurance Experiment?**

The **RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE)** is one of the most influential and methodologically rigorous studies in the field of health economics. Conducted over a **decade-long period**, it fundamentally reshaped how policymakers and health economists understand the effects of **insurance design**—especially **cost-sharing mechanisms**—on health behaviors and outcomes.

#### 📅 **Timeline**

- **Duration:** 1971 – 1982
    
- **Setting:** United States
    
- **Conducted by:** RAND Corporation
    
- **Scale:** Over **2,700 families** (totaling more than 7,700 individuals)
    

#### 🧪 **Study Design**

Participants were **randomly assigned** to different health insurance plans that varied by the **level of cost-sharing**, including:

|Plan Type|Cost-Sharing Description|
|---|---|
|**Free Care Plan**|100% of medical costs covered (no out-of-pocket)|
|**Coinsurance Plans**|Patients paid **25%, 50%, or 95%** of healthcare costs|
|**Catastrophic Coverage**|High deductibles but limited out-of-pocket maximums|

🔬 This **randomized controlled trial (RCT)** approach ensured robust and unbiased results—rare in large-scale health policy studies.

#### 🎯 **Purpose of the Study**

The experiment aimed to assess the impact of **cost-sharing** (i.e., out-of-pocket expenses borne by patients) on three key areas:

1. **Utilization** of health services
    
    - How much care people seek when they have to pay for part of it
        
2. **Quality** of care received
    
    - Whether cost-sharing affects the type or quality of services accessed
        
3. **Health outcomes**
    
    - Whether reductions in care lead to worsened or unchanged health
        

#### 📌 **Key Findings**

##### ✅ 1. **Cost-Sharing Decreases Utilization**

> As patients had to pay more out-of-pocket, they **used fewer health services**.

- This reduction was **observed across all types** of care:
    
    - Outpatient visits
        
    - Inpatient admissions
        
    - Preventive services
        
    - Emergency care
        

##### ✅ 2. **Cost-Sharing Lowers Overall Healthcare Costs**

> With fewer services being used, **total health expenditures** were reduced for both the payer and the system.

##### ⚠️ 3. **No Significant Impact on Quality or Health Outcomes**

> Despite reduced usage, **general health status remained unchanged**—especially for the average, healthy adult.

- **However**: Among certain vulnerable populations (e.g., low-income individuals with chronic illnesses), some **adverse effects** were observed when care was reduced.
    

#### 🧠 **Policy Implications**

This study provided the **empirical foundation** for key debates in health insurance design:

|Insight|Policy Impact|

## 📉 **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**

> Measures responsiveness of **quantity demanded** to a **change in price**

---

### 📉 **Elasticity of Demand – Measuring Responsiveness in Economics**

#### 🎯 **What Is Elasticity of Demand?**

In economics, **elasticity of demand** is a concept used to **measure how responsive the quantity demanded** of a good or service is to changes in one of its **determinants**.

> 📌 **Key Idea:**  
> Elasticity tells us **how much** demand changes when something like **price**, **income**, or **the price of another good** changes.

#### 📊 **Purpose of Studying Elasticity**

The concept of elasticity helps economists and policymakers **quantify** the degree of sensitivity or responsiveness in consumer behavior.

- It is not enough to know that “demand falls when price rises.”
    
- We want to know: **“By how much?”**
    

#### 🔍 **Focus in This Section: Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**

While elasticity can refer to various determinants, this section emphasizes the most common and fundamental one:

> 🔁 **Elasticity of demand with respect to the price of the good itself.**

This is known as the **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**.

#### 🧠 **Why Is PED Important in Health Economics?**

Healthcare systems often rely on **pricing policies**, such as:

- 🏥 Consultation fees
    
- 💊 Co-payments for medication
    
- 🧾 Insurance premiums
    
- 📉 Subsidies or taxes (e.g., sugar tax, cigarette tax)
    

Understanding PED helps determine whether such pricing changes will meaningfully **alter demand**, especially in sectors like public health where **access and affordability** are key.

#### 📈 **Example of Application**

Let’s say a government increases the price of outpatient visits to reduce unnecessary demand. Will this actually **reduce utilization**, or will people **still visit as often**?

➡️ The answer depends on the **elasticity of demand**.

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Elasticity of Demand**|Measures how much demand changes in response to changes in determinants|
|**Primary Focus Here**|How quantity demanded changes with respect to **price**|
|**Purpose**|To **quantify** behavioral response, not just assume a direction|
|**Relevance in Healthcare**|Helps design policies like subsidies, insurance co-payments, or taxation|

### 📉 **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**

#### 📌 **What Is PED?**

**Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)** is a fundamental concept in economics that measures how **responsive consumers are to changes in price**.

> 🔍 In simpler terms:  
> **How much does quantity demanded change when the price changes?**

It quantifies whether a price change leads to a **big**, **moderate**, or **small** shift in how much people want to buy.

#### 🧮 **The PED Formula**

##### $\text{PED} = \frac{\%\text{ Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\%\text{ Change in Price}}$

Where:

- **%Δ Quantity Demanded** = (New Q - Old Q) ÷ Old Q × 100
    
- **%Δ Price** = (New P - Old P) ÷ Old P × 100
    

📌 _The result is usually a **negative number**, because price and quantity move in opposite directions. But we often refer to the **absolute value** for interpretation._

#### ✨ **Examples of PED in Action**

Let’s apply this formula to understand different types of responsiveness:

|Scenario|PED Value|Interpretation|
|---|---|---|
|Price ↑ 10%, Quantity Demanded ↓ 5%|-0.5|Inelastic: Demand drops **less** than price rises|
|Price ↑ 10%, Quantity Demanded ↓ 10%|-1.0|Unit Elastic: Demand drops **equal** to price|
|Price ↑ 10%, Quantity Demanded ↓ 20%|-2.0|Elastic: Demand drops **more** than price rises|

🧠 These examples show that **elasticity affects total revenue and behavior**.

#### 📊 **Types of Price Elasticity of Demand**

|**PED Value**|**Elasticity Type**|**Interpretation**|
|---|---|---|
|**PED > 1**|**Elastic**|Quantity demanded changes **more** than price (%ΔQ > %ΔP)|
|**0 < PED < 1**|**Inelastic**|Quantity demanded changes **less** than price (%ΔQ < %ΔP)|
|**PED = 1**|**Unit Elastic**|Quantity and price change by the **same percentage**|

#### 📌 **Quick Reference Table**

|**Elasticity Type**|**Consumer Sensitivity**|**Behavioral Insight**|
|---|---|---|
|**Elastic (PED > 1)**|High|Consumers reduce demand **significantly** when price rises|
|**Inelastic (PED < 1)**|Low|Consumers reduce demand **slightly** despite price changes|
|**Unit Elastic (PED = 1)**|Medium|Total expenditure stays roughly the **same**|

#### 🧾 **Relevance in Health Economics**

Understanding PED helps inform pricing, subsidy, and regulation policies in healthcare:

- 💊 **Essential medicines** often have **inelastic demand** → price increases may not reduce usage, but can create **equity concerns**.
    
- 🩺 **Elective or luxury healthcare** (e.g., cosmetic surgery) tends to have **elastic demand** → price-sensitive patients may opt out.
    
- 📈 **PED data** helps shape **co-payment models**, **insurance design**, and **pricing policies** in public vs private healthcare.
    

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Element|Summary|
|---|---|
|**PED measures**|Responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price|
|**PED > 1**|Elastic: Big behavior change|
|**PED < 1**|Inelastic: Small behavior change|
|**PED = 1**|Unit elastic: Balanced response|
|**Healthcare Application**|Helps design equitable and efficient pricing/subsidy policies|

### ⚖️ **Perfectly Elastic vs Perfectly Inelastic Demand**

#### 🎯 **What Are Extreme Cases of Elasticity?**

In real-world economics, most goods and services have **elasticity values between 0 and infinity**.  
However, at the **theoretical extremes**, we observe two contrasting concepts:

- **Perfectly Inelastic Demand (Elasticity = 0)**
    
- **Perfectly Elastic Demand (Elasticity = ∞)**
    

These help us understand the full spectrum of consumer responsiveness.

#### 🧱 **1. Perfectly Inelastic Demand**

##### $\text{PED} = 0$

##### 📌 **Definition:**

> **Quantity demanded remains constant regardless of price changes.**

- Consumers will **buy the same amount** even if the price increases or decreases.
    
- Price has **no effect** on demand.
    

##### 🧂 **Examples:**

|Good/Service|Why It’s Inelastic|
|---|---|
|**Essential medicines** 💊|Life-saving; no substitutes; must be purchased|
|**Table salt** 🧂|Extremely cheap and used in small quantities|

Even if the price of insulin **doubles**, diabetic patients **still need it**—demand does not drop.

##### 📈 **Graphical Representation:**

- The **demand curve is vertical** (straight up and down).
    
- **No matter the price**, the **quantity demanded stays fixed**.
    

##### 🧠 **Interpretation:**

- These goods are considered **necessities** with **no immediate alternatives**.
    
- In health economics, perfectly inelastic demand reflects situations where patients have **no choice** but to consume the good.
    

#### 🪟 **2. Perfectly Elastic Demand**

##### $\text{PED} = \infty$

##### 📌 **Definition:**

> **Any price increase, no matter how small, causes demand to fall to zero.**

- Consumers are **infinitely sensitive** to price.
    
- They will only buy at a **specific price**, and **not a cent more**.
    

##### 🧴 **Examples:**

|Good/Service|Why It’s Elastic|
|---|---|
|**Generic pharmaceutical brands**|If **identical substitutes** are available, buyers will choose the cheapest|
|**Commodity goods (e.g., bottled water)**|Where **perfect competition** exists|

If two pharmacies sell **identical paracetamol**, and one increases its price by RM0.01, **all buyers will shift to the cheaper one**.

##### 📉 **Graphical Representation:**

- The **demand curve is horizontal** (perfectly flat).
    
- At one price point, demand is **very high**; any increase → **demand = 0**
    

##### 🧠 **Interpretation:**

- Perfect elasticity assumes **perfect information** and **perfect substitutes**, which rarely exist in reality.
    
- However, it illustrates how **competitive markets** behave when products are **undifferentiated**.
    

#### 🔁 **Comparison Table: Perfectly Inelastic vs Perfectly Elastic**

|Feature|Perfectly Inelastic 🧱|Perfectly Elastic 🪟|
|---|---|---|
|**PED Value**|0|∞|
|**Demand Curve Shape**|Vertical|Horizontal|
|**Consumer Behavior**|Buy regardless of price|Only buy at one specific price|
|**Examples**|Insulin, salt|Generic drugs with perfect substitutes|
|**Real-World Usefulness**|Medical necessity pricing|Understanding competition & pricing sensitivity|

#### 🩺 **Implications in Health Economics**

- **Perfectly inelastic demand** is a critical concept for public health financing:
    
    - It justifies **price regulation** or **government subsidies** for life-saving medicines.
        
- **Perfectly elastic demand** highlights the importance of **price sensitivity** in competitive markets:
    
    - Encourages **bulk procurement** and **price transparency** in pharmaceuticals.
        

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Concept|Summary|
|---|---|
|**Perfectly Inelastic**|Quantity demanded doesn't change with price|
|**Perfectly Elastic**|Any price increase = zero demand|
|**Health Application**|Helps design **pricing policies**, **insurance**, and **procurement strategies**|

### 🧭 **Why Use Elasticity?**

#### 🎯 **Purpose of Elasticity in Economics**

Understanding **elasticity** isn’t just about knowing how consumers react to price changes. It’s a **powerful analytical tool** that helps economists and policymakers make **comparisons, projections, and decisions** across **diverse goods, services, and markets**.

#### 🧮 **Elasticity Is a Unit-Free Measure**

One of the most important features of elasticity is that it is **dimensionless**—it doesn’t depend on the **units of measurement** used (like RM, USD, kg, or litres).

> ✅ This makes it a **universal tool** for comparison.

#### 📌 **Benefits of Being Unit-Free**

##### 📊 1. **Cross-Market Comparisons**

- You can **compare elasticity of demand** between **totally different products or services**, such as:
    
    - Medications vs Food
        
    - Hospital visits vs Electronics
        
    - Urban vs Rural health services
        

Even if one good is measured in **bottles (e.g., antibiotics)** and another in **visits (e.g., clinic consultations)**, their **PED values** can still be compared meaningfully.

##### 🌍 2. **International Comparability**

- Policies and market trends vary across **countries and currencies**.
    
- Elasticity allows economists to **analyze behavior globally** without worrying about currency conversions or measurement scales.
    

For instance:

> A PED of -0.7 for outpatient visits in Malaysia  
> can be compared to a PED of -0.6 in Indonesia  
> despite differences in healthcare pricing and income levels.

##### 💡 3. **Policy Design Based on Responsiveness, Not Magnitude**

- Elasticity reveals **how sensitive** people are to changes, not just how much they consume.
    
- This helps in designing:
    
    - 💸 **Co-payment strategies**
        
    - 🏥 **Subsidy schemes**
        
    - 🧾 **Price ceilings or taxes**
        

🧠 _For example:_

> A 5% price increase might reduce demand significantly in one market (elastic),  
> but barely affect another (inelastic)—even if both are priced similarly.

#### 🧠 **In Summary**

|Feature|Why It Matters 📌|
|---|---|
|**Unit-free**|Makes comparison across goods/services fair and simple|
|**Cross-sector usability**|Allows decision-making across industries or markets|
|**Globally comparable**|Enables economic insights across countries and contexts|
|**Behavior-focused**|Emphasizes responsiveness rather than raw quantity|

#### ✅ **Key Takeaway**

> **Elasticity simplifies economic analysis** by removing the barriers of unit measurement.  
> It lets us **focus on behavior**—how much people **respond**—rather than just numbers.

In health economics, this makes elasticity an essential tool for evaluating demand patterns, forecasting service utilization, and crafting responsive, data-driven policies.

### 📊 **Examples of Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**

#### 📌 **Applying PED in Real Life**

After understanding what **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)** is, it's important to see **how it behaves across different goods and services** in real-world markets.

> These examples, drawn from economic studies (notably **Folland & Goodman**), reveal how **different products** vary in how **price-sensitive** consumers are to them.

#### 📋 **PED Examples Table**

|🛒 **Good or Service**|📉 **PED Value**|🔍 **Interpretation**|
|---|---|---|
|**Apples (US)**|**1.15**|**Elastic** – Quantity demanded changes **more** than price|
|**Beef (UK)**|**1.45**|**Elastic** – Consumers are very price-sensitive|
|**Bread (UK)**|**0.26**|**Inelastic** – Demand hardly changes with price|
|**Cigarettes (US)**|**0.30 – 0.50**|**Inelastic** – Addictive nature limits response to price|

> 📌 _Note: All PED values are in absolute terms. While technically negative, we drop the minus sign for interpretive ease._

#### 🧠 **What These Numbers Tell Us**

Let’s break it down:

##### 🍎 Apples (PED = 1.15)

- A 10% increase in price results in an **11.5% drop** in quantity demanded.
    
- **Elastic** → People **can and will switch** to substitutes (e.g., bananas, oranges).
    

##### 🥩 Beef (PED = 1.45)

- Highly elastic → People quickly reduce beef consumption if it gets pricier.
    
- Reflects its **luxury or premium nature** in some households.
    

##### 🍞 Bread (PED = 0.26)

- A **necessity** with **few substitutes**, leading to **low responsiveness**.
    
- Consumers continue buying it **even if price rises**.
    

##### 🚬 Cigarettes (PED = 0.30 – 0.50)

- Inelastic because of **addiction and habitual use**.
    
- This makes it a **prime candidate for taxation** policies (e.g., sin taxes), since demand won’t plummet and revenue can be raised.
    

#### 🩺 **Relevance to Health Economics**

This comparison is particularly valuable for:

- 💸 Designing effective **tax policies** (e.g., sugar tax, cigarette tax)
    
- 🏥 Understanding how people respond to **price changes in essential vs elective care**
    
- 🧠 Informing **behavioral interventions** and **public health campaigns**
    

#### 🔑 **Key Takeaways**

|Lesson|Why It Matters in Public Health 👩🏻‍⚕️|
|---|---|
|Different goods have different PEDs|One-size-fits-all pricing policies won’t work|
|Inelastic goods = steady demand|Useful for revenue generation (e.g., through taxation)|
|Elastic goods = responsive demand|Useful for behavior change (e.g., encouraging healthier options)|
|Healthcare services vary by context|Essential vs non-essential, insured vs out-of-pocket|

### ⚠️ **Misinterpretations of Inelastic Demand in Health**

#### 🧠 **Why This Section Matters**

The concept of **inelastic demand**—where quantity demanded changes little in response to price—can be misunderstood in **healthcare settings**, especially in **low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)**.

This section highlights **common misinterpretations** and explains why they can lead to flawed policy decisions and **adverse health consequences**.

#### 🚨 1. **Baseline Underutilization in Developing Countries**

> **Even before prices rise, healthcare utilization is already too low.**

- Many developing countries start from a point of **underuse**, not overuse.
    
- When price increases are introduced—such as user fees or co-payments—they **further suppress already insufficient care-seeking**.
    

🧠 **Implication:**  
Raising prices under the assumption that demand is inelastic **can be dangerous** in these settings.  
It results in **even less access** to vital services and leads to **worsening health outcomes**.

#### 🧪 2. **“Frivolous Demand” Is Not a Major Issue in Rural Settings**

> Contrary to popular belief, people in rural and poor settings **do not overuse health services.**

📊 **Example:**

- In **Burkina Faso**, average health service use was just **0.31 visits per capita/year**.
    

That’s **less than one visit per person annually**, far below what would be considered “frivolous.”

🧠 **Implication:**  
Policymakers should **not assume moral hazard or unnecessary care** in such contexts.  
The **real issue** is often **lack of access**, **low awareness**, or **high indirect costs** (e.g., transport, time off work).

#### 💸 3. **Equity Concerns: The Poor Suffer Most**

> Inelastic demand ≠ equal impact.

- Even if demand doesn’t drop drastically across the board, **price increases disproportionately harm**:
    
    - 🧒 The **young**
        
    - 👩‍👧‍👦 The **poor**
        
    - 🧓 The **elderly or chronically ill**
        
- These groups typically have **higher need but lower ability to pay**.
    

🧠 **Implication:**  
Assuming that price increases are “harmless” due to inelastic demand **ignores equity**.  
It can deepen **existing socioeconomic disparities** in access to healthcare.

#### 🧒🏽 4. **Children’s Health Risks**

> When demand falls due to price, **children often pay the steepest price**—literally and figuratively.

- Reduced care leads to:
    
    - **Missed treatments**
        
    - **Skipped immunizations**
        
    - **Delayed diagnoses**
        
- These can result in:
    
    - **Preventable deaths**
        
    - **Increased disease burden**
        
    - **Higher long-term costs to the health system**
        

🔁 **Negative externalities** occur when one person’s underuse of care **harms others**, such as:

- Outbreaks due to **low immunization coverage**
    
- Higher burden on healthcare due to **advanced-stage diseases**
    

#### **🧩 Summary Table – Misconceptions About Inelastic Demand**

|**Misinterpretation**|❌ **Why It’s Flawed**|✅ **What to Consider Instead**|
|---|---|---|
|Demand is inelastic, so prices won’t affect access|Care is already underutilized in many LMICs|Even small price changes can deter use in fragile systems|
|People overuse care in poor settings|Data shows extremely low utilization rates|The issue is **underuse**, not overuse|
|Inelastic demand makes price hikes fair|**Poor and vulnerable** are hit hardest|Equity must guide policy decisions|
|Children will be fine without a few visits|Leads to **missed vaccines**, poor outcomes, and social costs|Prevention is better—and cheaper—than delayed treatment|

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

- Inelasticity **does not justify** raising prices in health systems with **baseline underuse**.
    
- Assumptions about **frivolous demand** in LMICs are largely **unsupported by data**.
    
- Price increases can **amplify inequality**, disproportionately affecting those who need care most.
    
- **Public health externalities**, especially in **child health**, require **proactive protection**, not passive economic reasoning.

## 🔁 **Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED)**

> Measures how demand for one good changes when the **price of another** good changes.

---

### 🔁 **Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED)**

#### 🎯 **What Is Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED)?**

While **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)** looks at how the demand for a product responds to **its own price**, **Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED)** examines how the **demand for one good (A)** changes when the **price of a different good (B)** changes.

> 💡 In short:  
> **CED tells us if two goods are related—and how.**

#### 🧮 **CED Formula**

##### $\text{CED}_{AB} = \frac{\%\text{ Change in Quantity Demanded of A}}{\%\text{ Change in Price of B}}$


Where:

- **CEDAB** = Cross Elasticity of Demand of **A** with respect to **B**
    
- **Quantity Demanded of A** = How much people buy of good A
    
- **Price of B** = The price of good B
    

#### 🔍 **What Does CED Tell Us?**

CED helps identify whether goods are:

|Relationship|CED Sign|Interpretation|
|---|---|---|
|**Substitutes**|**Positive (+)**|As price of B increases, demand for A increases (e.g., tea vs coffee)|
|**Complements**|**Negative (−)**|As price of B increases, demand for A decreases (e.g., insulin and syringes)|
|**Unrelated Goods**|**Zero (≈0)**|Price of B has no effect on demand for A|

#### ☕🫖 **Examples of Cross Elasticity Relationships**

|Good A|Good B|Relationship|CED Sign|Explanation|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Coffee**|**Tea**|Substitutes|+|If tea becomes expensive, people buy more coffee|
|**Toothbrushes**|**Toothpaste**|Complements|−|If toothpaste becomes expensive, people buy fewer brushes|
|**Insulin**|**Syringes**|Complements|−|Higher syringe prices discourage insulin use|
|**Antibiotics**|**Sunscreen**|Unrelated|0|No logical connection between their use or pricing|

#### 🩺 **Relevance in Health Economics**

CED is **particularly useful** in understanding:

##### 🧾 1. **Health Product Pricing**

- Helps anticipate how price changes in one health item may affect demand for another.
    
- Example: Raising the price of test strips may reduce demand for glucometers—even if their price remains the same.
    

##### 🧠 2. **Health Behavior Modeling**

- Predicts **substitution** behavior when services are similar (e.g., switching between public and private clinics).
    

##### 💊 3. **Bundled Healthcare Services**

- Understanding **complementarity** helps in designing bundled insurance packages or integrated service delivery (e.g., antenatal checkups + supplements).
    

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Aspect|Summary|
|---|---|
|**CED Definition**|Measures how demand for Good A responds to a price change in Good B|
|**Positive CED**|Indicates **substitute goods**|
|**Negative CED**|Indicates **complementary goods**|
|**CED ≈ 0**|Indicates **no relationship**|
|**Healthcare Relevance**|Helps in pricing strategies, subsidy planning, and service integration|

---

### 🔁 **Substitute Goods** 🍎🍊

#### 🧠 **What Are Substitute Goods?**

**Substitute goods** are products or services that consumers can use **in place of one another** to satisfy the same need or want.

> ✅ When the **price of one good increases**, consumers often **switch to a cheaper alternative**—its **substitute**.

#### 📈 **Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED) for Substitutes**

- For substitute goods, the **Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED)** is **positive**:
    

$\text{CED} > 0$


- A **rise in the price** of Good B leads to an **increase in the demand** for Good A.
    

#### ✨ **Examples of Substitute Goods**

|Good A|Good B|Relationship|Why They’re Substitutes 🧠|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Apples**|**Oranges**|🍎 ↔ 🍊|Both are fruits—consumers may switch easily|
|**Butter**|**Margarine**|🧈 ↔ 🧈|Similar use in cooking and baking|
|**Cakes**|**Chocolates**|🍰 ↔ 🍫|Both are dessert treats that satisfy sweet cravings|

#### 🧮 **CED Calculation Example**

> Suppose the **price of oranges increases by 10%**, and as a result, the **quantity demanded for apples increases by 5%**.

##### $\text{CED}_{\text{Apples, Oranges}} = \frac{+5\%}{+10\%} = +0.5$


📌 **Interpretation:**

- Apples and oranges are **moderately substitutable**.
    
- A price hike in oranges leads to a **measurable shift** in apple demand.
    

#### 🩺 **Relevance in Health Economics**

Understanding substitute goods is essential for:

##### ✅ 1. **Policy Planning & Price Regulation**

- If branded medications become expensive, demand may shift to **generics**.
    
- Knowing the degree of substitution helps in **regulating essential medicines**.
    

##### ✅ 2. **Behavioral Health Interventions**

- If sugary soda prices rise (e.g., sugar tax), demand may shift to **diet beverages or bottled water**.
    
- Helps design **nudges** that guide healthier consumer choices.
    

##### ✅ 3. **Service Substitution in Healthcare**

- Patients may choose between:
    
    - Public vs private clinics
        
    - In-person vs telemedicine
        
- Understanding substitution patterns supports better **health system design** and **cost planning**.
    

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Element|Summary|
|---|---|
|**Substitute Goods**|Can replace each other in consumption|
|**CED Sign**|**Positive (+)**|
|**Higher price of Good B**|→ Increases demand for Good A|
|**Health Economics Insight**|Supports policy design, pricing, and service substitution analysis|

### 🧲 **Complementary Goods** 🖨️🖋️

#### 🧠 **What Are Complementary Goods?**

**Complementary goods** are products that are typically **used together**. The consumption of one good often **requires or increases the consumption of another**.

> ✅ When the **price of one good rises**, demand for its complement tends to **fall**.

#### 📉 **Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED) for Complements**

- For complementary goods, the **Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED)** is **negative**:
##### $\text{CED} < 0$

- A **price increase in Good B** leads to a **decrease in demand for Good A** (its complement).

#### ✨ **Examples of Complementary Goods**

|Good A|Good B|Relationship|Why They’re Complements 🧩|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Printers**|**Ink Cartridges**|🖨️ + 🖋️|A printer is useless without ink|
|**Shavers**|**Razor Blades**|🪒 + 🔪|Shaver handles need blades to function|
|**Glucometers**|**Test Strips**|💉 + 📊|Used together for blood glucose monitoring|

#### 🧮 **CED Calculation Example**

> Suppose the **price of printers increases by 10%**, and this causes the **quantity demanded of ink cartridges to fall by 5%**:

##### $\text{CED}_{\text{Cartridges, Printers}} = \frac{-5\%}{+10\%} = -0.5$

📌 **Interpretation:**

- The negative value confirms that the two goods are **complements**.
    
- The demand for cartridges **decreases** as printers become more expensive.
    

#### 🩺 **Relevance in Health Economics**

Understanding complementary relationships is vital in many healthcare contexts:

##### ✅ 1. **Medical Devices & Consumables**

- Example: **Glucometers and test strips**, or **insulin pens and needles**
    
- Pricing one item too high can **discourage use of both**, even if one remains affordable.
    

##### ✅ 2. **Bundled Interventions**

- Health programs often combine services:
    
    - **Antenatal checkups + iron supplements**
        
    - **Vaccines + immunization cards + follow-ups**
        
- Policymakers must ensure all components remain **affordable and accessible** to **maximize impact**.
    

##### ✅ 3. **Insurance & Coverage Planning**

- Insurance should **cover complementary goods/services** together.
    
- Omitting a complement (e.g., covering insulin but not syringes) reduces the **effectiveness of care**.

|**Used together**|One good increases usefulness of the other|
|**CED Sign**|**Negative (−)**|
|**Price ↑ for B → Demand ↓ for A**|Because higher total cost discourages combined consumption|
|**Healthcare Implication**|Bundled access must be ensured for optimal health outcomes|

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

- **Complementary goods must be considered together** in both pricing and policy.
    
- A price hike in one can **discourage use of the other**, leading to **underuse** and **poorer health outcomes**.
    
- In healthcare, most **treatments, devices, and services are interdependent**, so integrated thinking is essential.

### ⚖️ **Independent Goods** 🌹📻

#### 🧠 **What Are Independent Goods?**

**Independent goods** (also called **unrelated goods**) are products or services that have **no direct relationship** in terms of consumption or usage.

> ✅ A change in the **price of one good** does **not affect the demand** for the other.

In other words, consumers make purchase decisions for each **independently**, without considering the other.

#### 📉 **Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED) for Independent Goods**

For goods that are unrelated, the **Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED)** is **approximately zero**:
##### $\text{CED} \approx 0$

This means that even a significant price change in Good B will **not cause any meaningful change** in the quantity demanded of Good A.

#### ✨ **Examples of Independent Goods**

|Good A|Good B|Why They’re Independent 🧩|
|---|---|---|
|**Flowers**|**Radios**|Completely different purposes (aesthetic vs tech)|
|**Shoes**|**Tables**|No direct usage relationship|
|**Durians**|**Apples**|Although both are fruits, consumption is separate|

Even if the price of radios drops sharply, people **will not buy more flowers** as a result—these goods are **functionally and emotionally unrelated**.

#### 🧾 **Application in Health Economics**

While most health-related goods are **linked**, understanding independence is still important in the following contexts:

##### ✅ 1. **Budget Allocation**

- When allocating funds across departments or services, knowing which goods/services are **independent** avoids unnecessary linkage in decision-making.
    
- Example: Cost changes in **dental floss** should not influence demand projections for **eyeglasses**.
    

##### ✅ 2. **Policy Design**

- Avoid assuming behavioral spillover between unrelated interventions.
    
    - E.g., a **campaign to reduce smoking** won’t affect demand for **vitamin supplements**, if they’re not functionally connected.
        

##### ✅ 3. **Public Health Messaging**

- Helps distinguish which programs may need **separate** communication or subsidy strategies.
    

#### 📊 Summary Table – Independent Goods

|Feature|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**No usage relationship**|Consumption of one does **not require or affect** the other|
|**CED Value**|**Approximately zero**|
|**Price change in Good B**|Does **not affect** quantity demanded for Good A|
|**Example**|Durians & Apples, Flowers & Radios|
|**Policy Implication**|Independent goods require **separate pricing, marketing, and planning**|

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

- **Independent goods** are unrelated in both **usage and consumer decision-making**.
    
- They have a **CED close to zero**, meaning price changes in one don’t influence demand for the other.
    
- In health economics, understanding **what is not connected** helps **streamline decision-making**, **allocate resources logically**, and **avoid overgeneralization**.

### 📚 **Case Study: Price Effects on Health Demand**

#### 🎯 **Purpose of the Case Study**

This case study presents **real-world data** on how **pricing affects healthcare utilization**. The findings are based on a **1975 health demand survey**, analyzing the behavior of individuals in response to **changes in cost** across different healthcare sectors.

> 💡 It illustrates the **practical application of elasticity concepts**—both **price elasticity** and **cross elasticity**—within healthcare systems.

#### 📊 **Summary Table: Key Elasticity Findings**

|**Category**|**Value**|**Insight**|
|---|---|---|
|**Outpatient Care – Price Elasticity (PED)**|**-0.04**|**Very inelastic** – Price has **minimal effect** on demand|
|**Public vs Private Care – Cross Elasticity**|**+0.15**|Small substitution – As **private prices rise**, **public care use increases** slightly|
|**Traditional vs Western Medicine – Cross Elasticity**|**+0.05**|Weak substitution – People **slightly shift** between the two when prices change|

#### 📈 **Interpretation of the Findings**

##### 1. 🏥 **Outpatient Care (PED = -0.04)**

- This value is **very close to zero**, indicating **highly inelastic demand**.
    
- Even if the **cash price for outpatient care rises**, people **continue to seek care**.
    

🧠 **Implication:**

- Outpatient services, especially **basic and essential care**, are **needs-driven**.
    
- Policies aiming to reduce usage by raising prices may be **ineffective** and could **harm access**.
    

##### 2. 🏛️🏥 **Cross Elasticity: Public vs Private Care (CED = +0.15)**

- A **positive CED** suggests a **substitution effect**.
    
- As the **price of private care increases**, some individuals **shift to public services**.
    
- However, the low value (**+0.15**) indicates that **this effect is weak**.
    

🧠 **Implication:**

- Public and private sectors are **not perfect substitutes**.
    
- The **barriers to switching** may include:
    
    - Differences in perceived quality
        
    - Wait times
        
    - Income level
        
    - Insurance coverage
        

##### 3. 🌿⚕️ **Cross Elasticity: Traditional vs Western Care (CED = +0.05)**

- The CED is **positive**, but very small, indicating **minimal substitution**.
    
- When the price of **western medicine** rises, a **slight increase** in traditional medicine use occurs.
    

🧠 **Implication:**

- Patients **rarely switch** between traditional and western care solely due to price.
    
- **Cultural beliefs, trust, and accessibility** likely play a much bigger role in the choice between systems.
    

#### 🩺 **Relevance in Health Economics & Policy**

|**Policy Area**|**Implication of Case Study Findings**|
|---|---|
|**User fees in public clinics**|May **not deter overuse**, since demand is **very inelastic**|
|**Dual-sector planning**|Shifting burden between public and private sectors **requires more than pricing tools**|
|**Integration of care systems**|Efforts to encourage or regulate traditional/western care use must consider **non-price factors**|

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Concept|Summary|
|---|---|
|**Outpatient care is inelastic**|Pricing changes do **not significantly affect** care-seeking behavior|
|**Substitution between sectors exists**|But it is **weak**; many other factors influence healthcare choices|
|**Cultural & behavioral factors matter**|Especially in decisions between **modern and traditional care systems**|

> 📌 _Elasticity is not just a number—it reflects deeper social, economic, and cultural realities._

## 📦 **Supply of Goods & Services**

---

### 🏭 **Understanding Supply**

In economics, **supply** refers to the **seller’s perspective**—how much of a good or service a firm or provider is **willing and able** to sell over a given period.

> 📌 While **demand** reflects **consumer behavior**, **supply** reflects **producer decision-making**.

#### 🧾 **Key Elements of Supply**

##### ✅ **Definition:**

> Supply is the **quantity of a good or service** that firms are **willing and able to offer for sale** at various prices, over a specific period of time.

#### 💡 **Determinants of Supply**

The amount a firm supplies depends on multiple factors:

|🔍 **Determinant**|📝 **Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**Price of the product**|Higher prices offer **greater profit**, encouraging firms to **supply more**|
|**Costs of production**|Increased input costs (e.g., wages, raw materials) can **reduce supply**|
|**Prices of related goods**|Firms may switch production to more **profitable alternatives**|
|**Technology**|Advancements can **increase efficiency**, reducing costs and **boosting supply**|
|**Producer preferences**|Preferences or business goals can influence supply behavior (e.g., ethical sourcing)|

#### 🧠 **Healthcare Example**

In health economics, supply analysis helps explain:

- 🏥 How many hospital beds are provided
    
- 💊 How much medication is produced or stocked
    
- 🧑‍⚕️ How many hours a healthcare provider works
    

Each of these depends on:

- **Incentives**
    
- **Funding**
    
- **Regulations**
    
- **Human resource availability**
    

> 📌 _Healthcare supply is often more complex due to regulatory constraints and ethical considerations._

#### 🧮 **Supply Is Not Unlimited**

Unlike theoretical models, **real-world supply** is limited by:

- **Physical capacity** (e.g., number of machines or staff)
    
- **Budget limitations**
    
- **Training & licensing requirements** in healthcare settings
    

#### 📊 **Summary Table – Understanding Supply**

|**Concept**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**Supply = Seller’s View**|What firms are willing & able to offer|
|**Key Influencer**|**Price** is the most direct driver of supply|
|**Other Determinants**|Costs, technology, preferences, and prices of other goods|
|**Healthcare Context**|Supply of services is shaped by both market and non-market forces|

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

- Supply represents **provider behavior**, influenced by **market incentives and cost structures**.
    
- In healthcare, supply is subject to **ethical, technical, and systemic limitations**.
    
- Understanding supply helps policymakers plan for:
    
    - 🏥 Service provision
        
    - 📦 Resource allocation
        
    - 👩‍⚕️ Workforce distribution
        
    - 💰 Pricing and reimbursement strategies

### 📋 **Supply Schedule for Ice Cream Cones**

#### 🍦 **Introducing the Supply Schedule**

The **supply schedule** is a tabular representation that shows how the **quantity of a good supplied** changes in response to **variations in its price**.

> 🧠 It reflects the behavior of **sellers or producers**:  
> **As price increases, producers are willing to supply more.**

#### 📊 **Tabulated Example – Ice Cream Cones**

|💰 **Price per Cone (RM)**|🍦 **Quantity Supplied**|
|---|---|
|RM0.50|0|
|RM1.00|100|
|RM1.50|200|
|RM2.00|300|
|RM2.50|400|
|RM3.00|500|

##### 🔍 **What This Tells Us:**

- At **lower prices**, sellers are **less willing** to supply the good.
    
- As the price rises, **supply increases linearly** in this simplified example.
    

#### 📈 **The Supply Curve**

A **supply curve** is the graphical version of the supply schedule, plotting **price** on the Y-axis and **quantity supplied** on the X-axis.

##### 🟩 **Key Features of the Supply Curve:**

- **Upward-sloping** from left to right.
    
- Demonstrates a **positive relationship** between **price and quantity supplied**.
    
- The curve illustrates the **Law of Supply** in action (covered in the next section).
    

#### 🧠 **Why Do Producers Supply More at Higher Prices?**

- **Profit Incentive**: Higher prices increase potential revenue, motivating sellers to produce more.
    
- **Cost Recovery**: At low prices, covering costs may not be feasible.
    
- **Marginal Profitability**: Higher prices justify using more expensive or intensive production methods.
    

#### 🍦 **Ice Cream Cone Supply: A Simple Analogy**

Think of a street vendor selling ice cream:

- If each cone sells for RM0.50, it may not cover the cost of **ingredients, ice, and labor**.
    
- At RM2.50 per cone, the **profit margin justifies** making and selling more.
    
- At RM3.00, the seller may even consider expanding or staying open longer.
    

> 🔁 This mirrors real-world dynamics in **healthcare**, where services may not be supplied unless **costs are covered** and **returns are viable**.

#### 🩺 **Relevance in Health Economics**

In health systems:

- **Clinics may offer more services** if the **payment per service increases**.
    
- **Private providers** may expand operating hours or services when **returns justify it**.
    
- Supply elasticity can influence:
    
    - 🏥 Wait times
        
    - 🧑‍⚕️ Human resource availability
        
    - 💊 Stock of essential medicines
        

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Concept|Summary|
|---|---|
|**Supply Schedule**|Table showing quantity supplied at various price levels|
|**Supply Curve**|Upward-sloping graph showing positive price-supply relationship|
|**Higher Price = More Supply**|Due to increased incentives and profitability for producers|
|**Health Economics Impact**|Helps understand provider behavior, resource planning, and access|

### 📜 **Law of Supply**

#### ⚖️ **Definition of the Law of Supply**

> **All else being equal** (ceteris paribus):
> 
> - When the **price of a good or service increases**, the **quantity supplied increases**
>     
> - When the **price decreases**, the **quantity supplied decreases**
>     

This is a **fundamental principle** in economics that reflects the **producer’s perspective** and motivation.

#### 🔁 **How the Law of Supply Works**

- Producers respond to **price signals** in the market.
    
- A **higher price** offers:
    
    - 💰 **Greater potential profits**
        
    - 💼 **Justification for higher production efforts or investments**
        
- A **lower price** may result in:
    
    - ❌ **Reduced profitability**
        
    - ⛔ **Withdrawal from production or market**
        

#### 📈 **Graphical Representation**

- The **supply curve** slopes **upward** from left to right.
    
- X-axis = **Quantity Supplied**
    
- Y-axis = **Price**
    
- As price increases, each point on the curve moves **higher and to the right**, reflecting **more supply** at higher price levels.
    

#### 🍦 **Ice Cream Cone Example Revisited**

Using the earlier **supply schedule for ice cream cones**:

|💰 Price per Cone (RM)|🍦 Quantity Supplied|
|---|---|
|RM0.50|0|
|RM1.00|100|
|RM1.50|200|
|RM2.00|300|
|RM2.50|400|
|RM3.00|500|

This demonstrates a **direct relationship** between **price** and **quantity supplied**, in full alignment with the **Law of Supply**.

#### 🩺 **Relevance in Health Economics**

While the Law of Supply holds in healthcare, there are **unique factors** to consider:

##### ✅ 1. **Incentives in Provider Behavior**

- Doctors or clinics may **increase service hours or patient load** if **reimbursements increase**.
    

##### ✅ 2. **Response to Market Prices**

- Pharmaceutical firms may **increase production** of high-priced drugs or **exit markets** for low-return generics.
    

##### ✅ 3. **Limitations in Elasticity**

- Healthcare supply may not always **adjust quickly** due to:
    
    - ⏳ **Training time for professionals**
        
    - 🏗️ **Facility limitations**
        
    - ⚖️ **Ethical and regulatory constraints**
        

#### 🔍 **Healthcare Examples of Supply Response**

|Scenario|Supply Response|
|---|---|
|**Increased surgery reimbursement**|Hospitals may offer **more surgeries** or hire more surgeons|
|**Subsidized vaccine program ends**|Clinics may **reduce vaccine availability**|
|**New profitable medical tech (e.g., MRI)**|Private providers may **invest in machines and advertise use**|

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Concept|Summary|
|---|---|
|**Law of Supply**|Price ↑ → Supply ↑; Price ↓ → Supply ↓ (ceteris paribus)|
|**Supply Curve**|Upward sloping; reflects positive price-supply relationship|
|**Producer Behavior**|Motivated by profitability and cost considerations|
|**Healthcare Considerations**|Supply responds to price but may be **constrained by ethics, training, and policy**|

### 🔧 **Supply Function**

#### 🧠 **What Is a Supply Function?**

The **supply function** is a **mathematical representation** that explains how the **quantity of a good or service supplied** is determined by various influencing factors.

> 📌 It captures the **relationship** between **supply quantity** and the **determinants of supply**.

#### 🧮 **The General Form of the Supply Function**

##### $Q_s = f(P, RP, C, T, \ldots)$

Where:

| Symbol | Meaning                                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Qₛ`   | Quantity Supplied                                |
| `P`    | Price of the good                                |
| `RP`   | Prices of **related goods**                      |
| `C`    | **Cost of production** (e.g., labor, materials)  |
| `T`    | **Technology** or **producer preferences**       |
| `...`  | Other possible factors (e.g., regulation, taxes) |

#### 🔍 **Explanation of Variables**

##### 💰 **P – Price of the Good**

- A direct driver of supply.
    
- As **P increases**, **Qs usually increases** (Law of Supply).
    

##### 🔄 **RP – Prices of Related Goods**

- When other products become more profitable, producers may **reallocate resources**, reducing supply of the original good.
    
    > Example: A pharmaceutical company may switch from producing antibiotics to vaccines if the latter yields better margins.
    

##### ⚙️ **C – Cost of Production**

- Includes wages, materials, utilities, etc.
    
- If **C increases**, it **reduces profitability**, causing **Qs to decrease**.
    

##### 🧪 **T – Technology or Preferences**

- **Improved technology** reduces production costs and boosts efficiency → **Qs increases**.
    
- **Producer preferences**, such as a mission to produce green products, also influence supply decisions.
    

#### 📈 **Real-World Healthcare Examples**

|Variable|Scenario in Health Sector|
|---|---|
|`P`|Surgeons may increase operations if reimbursement per surgery increases|
|`RP`|Clinics may shift services based on demand (e.g., shift from dental to aesthetic services)|
|`C`|A rise in staff salaries may reduce private clinic operating hours|
|`T`|Adoption of telemedicine platforms may increase service reach and quantity|

#### 📊 **Table: Effects of Supply Determinants**

|Determinant|Increases Qₛ?|Decreases Qₛ?|
|---|---|---|
|Price (`P`)|✅|❌ (if price falls)|
|Cost (`C`)|❌|✅ (if cost rises)|
|Related Goods (`RP`)|Depends|Depends on substitution effect|
|Technology (`T`)|✅|❌ (if obsolete or costly tech)|

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

- The **supply function** formally describes **how supply responds** to different economic variables.
    
- It's a **tool for prediction and policy planning**, especially in regulated sectors like healthcare.
    
- By manipulating these variables, **governments and organizations** can influence **health service availability** and **market outcomes**.

### 🔄 **Shift in Supply Curve**

#### 🧠 **What Is a Shift in the Supply Curve?**

A **shift in the supply curve** happens when the **quantity supplied changes** **at every price level**, due to factors **other than the good’s own price**.

> 📌 It reflects a change in the **underlying conditions** of supply—such as input costs, technology, or market structure.

#### 🧾 **Movement vs Shift: Know the Difference**

|Type of Change|Caused By|Visual Effect on Curve|
|---|---|---|
|**Movement along curve**|🔺🔻 Change in the **price** of the good itself|Moves up/down **on the same curve**|
|**Shift of the curve**|⚙️ Changes in **non-price factors**|Entire curve **moves left or right**|

#### 📉 **Example: Drop in Cost of Production**

Let’s say the cost of inputs like **sugar, milk, or eggs** used to produce ice cream **decreases**:

- 🧂 Sugar ↓
    
- 🥛 Milk ↓
    
- 🥚 Eggs ↓
    

#### ✨ Result:

- Ice cream becomes **cheaper to produce** ✅
    
- At every price point, producers are now willing to **supply more units**
    
- ➡️ **The supply curve shifts to the right** (⏩)
    

> 📈 More ice cream is now available **at the same price** as before.

#### 📊 **Graphical Representation**

- **Original Supply Curve (S₁)** represents initial conditions.
    
- **New Supply Curve (S₂)** lies **to the right** of S₁.
    
- This shift means **higher supply at all prices**.
    

#### 🏥 **Healthcare Example**

In health economics, similar supply shifts occur when:

- 💉 **Generic drugs** enter the market → **lower production costs** for providers
    
- 🖥️ **Technology improvements** (e.g., AI in diagnostics) reduce per-patient time → higher capacity
    
- 📦 **Bulk purchasing** of vaccines reduces unit cost → more available doses
    

#### 📦 **Summary Table – Rightward Shift in Supply**

|Cause of Shift|Impact on Supply|Curve Movement|
|---|---|---|
|Decrease in input costs (e.g., sugar)|More output at each price|⏩ Right shift|
|Technological improvement|Increased efficiency → higher production|⏩ Right shift|
|Government subsidies|Lowers effective production cost|⏩ Right shift|

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

- A **rightward shift** in the supply curve means **increased availability** of goods or services **at all price levels**.
    
- It is driven by **non-price factors**—especially cost reductions, technological progress, or policy incentives.
    
- In health systems, this can **improve access**, reduce **wait times**, and **enhance coverage**.

## 🛒 **Understanding Markets**

---

### 🧩 **What Is a Market?**

> A **market** consists of **all buyers and sellers** of a particular **good or service**.

It is the arena—whether **physical**, **digital**, or **institutional**—where **economic exchange** takes place.

#### 🌐 **Nature of a Market: Not Just a Place**

While many people picture traditional markets like a **bazaar** or **pasar malam**, economists use the term _market_ to mean **any system where transactions occur**, such as:

- 🛍️ A shopping mall
    
- 💻 An online platform (e.g., Shopee, Lazada)
    
- 🏥 The healthcare sector (e.g., buyers = patients, sellers = providers)
    
- 📱 Even mobile apps that connect gig workers with clients
    

> 📌 What matters is **not the location**, but the **existence of buyers and sellers**, and their **interaction through prices** and quantities.

#### 🧠 **Essential Components of a Market**

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|**Buyers**|Individuals or entities seeking to obtain a good/service|
|**Sellers**|Providers or firms offering the good/service for sale|
|**Product/Service**|The item being exchanged (tangible goods or intangible services)|
|**Medium of Exchange**|Usually money; may also involve barter in informal settings|
|**Price**|The agreed value for a transaction|

#### 🏥 **Healthcare as a Market**

In health economics, **markets exist for health-related goods and services**—but with **unique characteristics**:

|Element|Healthcare Market Example|
|---|---|
|**Buyers**|Patients, insurance companies, governments|
|**Sellers**|Hospitals, clinics, pharmaceutical companies|
|**Goods/Services**|Consultations, medications, surgical procedures|
|**Price**|Out-of-pocket payments, co-pays, insurance premiums|
|**Medium of Exchange**|Often indirect (via insurers/governments), not just cash|

#### ⚠️ **Market Complexity in Health Economics**

Markets in healthcare differ from other sectors due to:

- **Asymmetric information** (providers know more than patients)
    
- **Third-party payers** (insurers, government)
    
- **Regulatory oversight** (e.g., drug approval, price controls)
    
- **Non-profit motives** in public and NGO sectors
    
- **Moral and ethical considerations** in care provision
    

> 🧭 This makes healthcare markets **less “free”** and more **policy-dependent** than typical markets.

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Concept|Summary|
|---|---|
|**Market**|Any system of buyers and sellers engaging in exchange|
|**Doesn't need a location**|Can be physical, digital, or institutional|
|**Healthcare as a Market**|Involves unique players, structures, and regulations|
|**Importance in Economics**|Market analysis helps **understand behavior**, **set policies**, and **allocate resources efficiently**|

### 🔁 **Market Interactions**

#### 🌐 **How Markets Work: A Dynamic Exchange System**

At the heart of every market lies a **dynamic interaction** between three key players:

|👤 **Player**|🧠 **Role**|
|---|---|
|**👥 Buyers**|Determine how much they’re **willing and able to purchase**|
|**🏭 Sellers**|Decide how much they’re **willing and able to produce/supply**|
|**💸 Price**|Serves as the **balancing mechanism** between supply and demand|

This interaction **drives market behavior**, adjusting continuously to match conditions on both sides.

#### 🛠️ **The Core Mechanism: Price as the Balancer**

Price is not just a number—it acts as the **invisible hand** (Adam Smith’s term) that brings the market toward **equilibrium**.

##### 🔄 When Demand & Supply Shift:

- **Excess Demand** (Shortage): Buyers want more than is available  
    → 📈 Prices tend to **increase**  
    → 🏭 Sellers are incentivized to **produce more**
    
- **Excess Supply** (Surplus): More is supplied than buyers want  
    → 📉 Prices tend to **fall**  
    → 👥 Buyers are encouraged to **purchase more**
    

This ongoing **adjustment process** helps bring the market back to balance.

#### 📊 **Visual Summary: Roles in Market Interaction**

|Aspect|Demand Side 👥 (Buyers)|Supply Side 🏭 (Sellers)|
|---|---|---|
|Key Action|**Demand goods/services**|**Supply goods/services**|
|Decision Based On|Price, income, preferences|Price, costs, technology|
|Goal|Maximize **utility** (satisfaction)|Maximize **profit**|
|Reaction to Price ↑|Demand ↓ (buy less)|Supply ↑ (sell more)|
|Reaction to Price ↓|Demand ↑ (buy more)|Supply ↓ (sell less)|

#### 🏥 **In Health Economics Context**

Market interaction in healthcare is complex due to:

- ⛔ **Imperfect competition**
    
- 🤕 **Price-insensitive demand** (people still need treatment even if prices rise)
    
- 🧾 **Insurance and third-party payers** interfering with direct price signals
    
- ⚖️ **Moral obligations** on providers to offer care regardless of profit
    

Despite these, basic **economic principles** still help explain behaviors and policy outcomes in:

- 🏥 Public vs private hospital utilization
    
- 💊 Generic vs branded drug usage
    
- 🧑‍⚕️ Human resource supply in urban vs rural settings
    

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Concept|Summary|
|---|---|
|**Buyers**|Decide **how much to demand** based on price and preference|
|**Sellers**|Decide **how much to supply** based on price and cost|
|**Price**|**Signals and balances** both sides—adjusting to match supply & demand|
|**Health Economics**|Market rules still apply, but **with constraints and complexities**|

### 🔎 **Characteristics of Markets**

#### 🧠 **Why Market Characteristics Matter**

Markets are **not all the same**. Their **structure**—or how they are organized—directly affects:

- How prices are determined 💸
    
- How much choice consumers have 🛍️
    
- How providers behave 🧑‍⚕️
    
- How efficiently resources are allocated ⚖️
    

> 📌 Understanding **market characteristics** is essential for shaping policies, especially in sectors like healthcare where **access and equity** matter.

#### 🏗️ **Three Core Dimensions of Market Structure**

##### 1. 🧑‍💼 **Number of Sellers (Firms)**

- Markets may have:
    
    - A **single seller** (monopoly)
        
    - **Few sellers** (oligopoly)
        
    - **Many sellers** (perfect competition or monopolistic competition)
        

> 🏥 In healthcare, a **single public provider** in rural areas can resemble a **monopoly**, while urban settings may have **multiple competing clinics**.

##### 2. 🧾 **Product Nature: Identical vs Differentiated**

- **Identical (homogeneous)** goods → No distinction between producers
    
    - E.g., generic paracetamol tablets
        
- **Differentiated** goods → Each supplier offers a unique variant
    
    - E.g., branded vs generic drugs, or private vs public consultation services
        

> 🧠 Product differentiation influences **consumer loyalty**, **pricing power**, and **marketing strategies**.

##### 3. 🚪 **Barriers to Entry and Exit**

Barriers affect how **easily firms can enter or leave** the market:

- **Low barriers** = more competition, dynamic supply
    
- **High barriers** = less competition, entrenched players

### 🧱 **Types of Market Structures**

#### 🧭 **Why Market Structures Matter**

Market structure refers to the **competitive environment** in which firms operate. It shapes:

- 📈 **Pricing strategies**
    
- 💼 **Business behavior**
    
- 🔁 **Consumer choices**
    
- ⚖️ **Regulatory needs**
    

> 📌 In health economics, understanding market structures helps explain **how services are delivered**, **why prices vary**, and **what policies are needed**.

#### 🧊 **Overview Table – Types of Market Structures**

|🧱 **Structure**|🏢 **No. of Firms**|🎨 **Product Type**|🧠 **Key Feature**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Monopoly**|One|Unique|A single seller dominates; no competition|
|**Oligopoly**|Few|Similar or Differentiated|A few dominant firms; strategic interdependence|
|**Monopolistic Competition**|Many|Differentiated|Many sellers; product variation influences choice|
|**Perfect Competition** 🏆|Many|Identical (homogeneous)|No single seller controls price; full transparency|
|**Monopsony**|One (buyer)|Any|One dominant buyer; rarely discussed in depth here|

#### 🧩 **Breakdown of Each Structure**

##### 1. 🏰 **Monopoly**

- **One seller**, no close substitutes.
    
- High **barriers to entry** protect the firm.
    
- Can set prices **without competition**.
    

> 📍 _Example in healthcare_: A single government provider in a remote rural area.

##### 2. 🏗️ **Oligopoly**

- **Few large firms** dominate the market.
    
- Products may be **similar** (e.g., petrol) or **differentiated** (e.g., private hospitals).
    
- Firms may **collude** or compete, influencing market power.
    
- **Strategic decision-making** is key (e.g., pricing wars, advertising battles).
    

> 📍 _Example_: Several large private hospital chains in an urban area.

##### 3. 🛍️ **Monopolistic Competition**

- **Many sellers**, each offering a **slightly different product**.
    
- Differentiation can be based on:
    
    - Quality
        
    - Branding
        
    - Customer experience
        
- Firms have **some pricing power**, but competition keeps it in check.
    

> 📍 _Example_: General practitioner (GP) clinics—each offers different consultation style, wait time, or reputation.

##### 4. 🏆 **Perfect Competition**

- **Large number of firms**, none can influence price.
    
- Products are **identical**, buyers have **perfect information**.
    
- **Price takers**—they must accept the market price.
    
- No barriers to entry or exit.
    

> 📍 _Rare in healthcare_ due to:

 - Information asymmetry
     
 - Product differentiation
     
 - Ethical considerations
     

Still, this model serves as a **theoretical benchmark** for efficiency.

##### 5. 🛒 **Monopsony**

- A **single buyer** controls the market.
    
- Common in **public sector procurement**, like government purchasing from suppliers.
    

> 📍 _Example_: Ministry of Health as the sole buyer of vaccines from pharmaceutical companies.

> ⚠️ Not discussed in detail in this lecture but important in health systems.

#### 🧠 **Why This Matters in Health Economics**

- Health markets **rarely fit neatly** into one type.
    
- Often a **blend**, depending on:
    
    - Region (urban vs rural)
        
    - Sector (public vs private)
        
    - Service type (outpatient vs surgery vs pharma)
        

Understanding these structures helps:

 - 📊 **Design effective health policies**
     
 - 💰 **Address inefficiencies and equity**
     
 - 🛡️ **Regulate pricing and access**
     

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Concept|Summary|
|---|---|
|**Market structure**|Refers to **how competitive** a market is|
|**Monopoly**|One seller controls the market|
|**Oligopoly**|Few firms dominate; may collude or compete|
|**Monopolistic Competition**|Many sellers, **differentiated products**|
|**Perfect Competition**|Ideal model with many sellers, identical goods, and no market power|
|**Monopsony**|One buyer dominates the market|
|**Healthcare Implication**|Real-world healthcare markets are **mixed and imperfect**|

---

### 💯 **Perfectly Competitive Market**

#### 🏆 **What Is a Perfectly Competitive Market?**

A **perfectly competitive market** is the **idealized model** of how markets function **efficiently** when no single buyer or seller can control price.

> 📌 This structure maximizes **allocative and productive efficiency** and is often used as a **benchmark** for evaluating real-world markets—even though it rarely exists in pure form, especially in healthcare.

#### 🔍 **Key Characteristics of Perfect Competition**

Let’s break down the defining features:

##### 1. 👥 **Many Small Firms and Customers**

- Each firm is **insignificant relative to the total market**.
    
- No single buyer or seller has **market power** to influence the price.
    
- Firms are **price takers**, not price setters.
    

##### 2. 🧾 **Identical (Homogeneous) Products**

- Products are **perfect substitutes** across sellers.
    
- No **branding, quality variation, or differentiation**.
    
- Consumers do not care **who** they buy from—only the **price** matters.
    

> 📍 _Example (theoretical)_: Generic rice sold in a traditional market, all of same type and quality.

##### 3. 🚪 **Free Entry and Exit**

- **No barriers** to start or leave a business.
    
- Firms can **enter if profit exists** and **exit if losses occur**.
    
- This ensures that **economic profits tend to zero in the long run**.
    

> 🔁 This feature promotes **dynamic efficiency**, keeping the market competitive over time.

##### 4. 📢 **Perfect Information**

- **All buyers and sellers** know:
    
    - The **prices** of all goods and services
        
    - The **quality** of products
        
    - The **location and availability** of all firms
        

> 🔍 Information symmetry ensures **rational decision-making** on both sides.

#### 🎯 **Implications of Perfect Competition**

|Implication|Description|
|---|---|
|**Price = Marginal Cost (MC)**|Firms produce where P = MC → ensures **allocative efficiency**|
|**Normal Profit in Long Run**|Entry and exit drive profits to **zero economic profit**|
|**Productive Efficiency**|Firms operate at **lowest cost**, using optimal resource combinations|
|**No Deadweight Loss**|Social welfare is **maximized**|

#### ⚕️ **Why It's Rare in Healthcare**

Real-world healthcare markets **do not resemble** perfect competition due to:

- 🧠 **Information asymmetry** (e.g., patients can’t evaluate treatment quality)
    
- 🧑‍⚕️ **Provider-patient trust** and preference = differentiation
    
- 💰 **Barriers to entry** like licensing and capital requirements
    
- 💉 **Government regulation** of prices, access, and supply
    
- 📦 **Product heterogeneity**, especially in pharmaceuticals and specialized care
    

> 🛡️ Thus, healthcare markets tend to be **imperfect**, and **government intervention** is often necessary.

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Concept|Summary|
|---|---|
|**Perfect Competition**|Ideal market with **many firms, homogeneous products**, and no barriers|
|**Firms are Price Takers**|No single seller can influence price|
|**Long-Run Profit = 0**|Competition drives profits down|
|**Healthcare ≠ Perfect Market**|Real-world constraints limit competition and transparency|

### 🌟 **Why Is Perfect Competition Important?**

#### 🏆 **The Benchmark for Market Efficiency**

Even though **perfect competition** rarely exists in reality—especially in healthcare—it remains a **crucial theoretical model** in economics. It is used to:

- ✨ Benchmark **economic efficiency**
    
- 📏 Evaluate the **performance** of real-world markets
    
- ⚖️ Understand the **ideal allocation** of scarce resources
    

> 📌 When market mechanisms function **perfectly**, they ensure that goods and services are **produced and distributed optimally**—minimizing waste and maximizing societal welfare.

#### 🧠 **Adam Smith’s Insight**

> “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.”  
> — **Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations (1776)**

- In a perfectly competitive market, each individual **pursues their own self-interest**.
    
- Yet, through the **"invisible hand"** of the market, resources are allocated in a way that benefits **society as a whole**.
    
- The result? **Efficient use** of **scarce societal resources**.
    

#### 🧠 **Friedrich Engels’ Perspective**

> “Market competition is the most efficient way to match supply with demand, aligning production with consumer needs.”

- Engels recognized that under ideal conditions, markets **coordinate production decisions** with **consumer preferences**.
    
- This results in the **right goods** being made in the **right quantities** and sold to the **right people**, all through **price signals**—without a central planner.
    

#### ⚖️ **Economic Efficiency Achieved in Perfect Competition**

|Type of Efficiency|What It Means|Achieved in Perfect Competition?|
|---|---|---|
|**Allocative Efficiency**|Resources are distributed according to **consumer preferences**|✅ Yes|
|**Productive Efficiency**|Goods are produced using the **least-cost combination** of inputs|✅ Yes|
|**Dynamic Efficiency**|Innovation and improvement occur over time|⚠️ Not always (due to lack of profit incentive)|

> 📌 While **allocative** and **productive efficiency** are guaranteed, perfect competition may **lack innovation incentives** due to zero economic profit in the long run.

#### 🏥 **Relevance to Health Economics**

Even though health markets are far from perfectly competitive, this model is important because:

- 🎯 It helps identify **where the healthcare system is inefficient**
    
- 🧪 It shows **how far reality deviates** from the ideal
    
- 📚 It provides a **framework** to justify **policy interventions** (e.g., subsidies, regulations, universal coverage)
    

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

| Idea                          | Summary                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Perfect competition**       | Theoretical ideal for **maximizing efficiency** in markets            |
| **Adam Smith**                | Market ensures **efficient use** of scarce resources                  |
| **Friedrich Engels**          | Markets **align production with consumer needs**                      |
| **Application in healthcare** | A benchmark to identify inefficiencies and **guide policy solutions** |

### ⚖️ **Equilibrium of Supply and Demand**

#### 🌐 **What Is Market Equilibrium?**

> **Equilibrium** is the point where **quantity supplied equals quantity demanded** at a specific price.  
> At this point, the market is **in balance**—there are **no shortages** and **no surpluses**.

In a **competitive market**, forces of supply and demand **naturally adjust** prices and quantities until this equilibrium is achieved.

#### ⚙️ **How It Works: The Adjustment Mechanism**

##### 📉 If the Price Is Too High:

- **Supply exceeds demand** → **Surplus** occurs
    
- Sellers are unable to sell all their goods
    
- ➡️ They lower prices to **clear excess inventory**
    
- ➡️ As price drops, **demand rises** and **supply falls**
    
- ✅ Eventually, balance is restored
    

##### 📈 If the Price Is Too Low:

- **Demand exceeds supply** → **Shortage** occurs
    
- Buyers compete for limited goods
    
- ➡️ Sellers **raise prices**
    
- ➡️ As price rises, **demand falls** and **supply increases**
    
- ✅ Market reaches equilibrium again
    

#### 🍦 **Example: Ice Cream Cone Market**

Let’s apply this with a real-life example used in the lecture:

##### ❌ **If Price = RM2.50**

- **Quantity Supplied** = 500 cones
    
- **Quantity Demanded** = 300 cones
    
- 🧊 **Surplus** = 200 cones  
    ➡️ Sellers will lower the price to sell the excess stock.
    

##### ❌ **If Price = RM1.50**

- **Quantity Supplied** = 200 cones
    
- **Quantity Demanded** = 400 cones
    
- 🔥 **Shortage** = 200 cones  
    ➡️ Price will rise as customers compete for limited cones.
    

#### ✅ **The Equilibrium Point**

> When **Quantity Supplied = Quantity Demanded**

At this price:

- Market is **stable**
    
- **No incentive** for buyers or sellers to change their behavior
    
- Resources are **efficiently allocated**
    

#### 📊 **Summary Table – Ice Cream Cone Market Equilibrium**

|💰 **Parameter**|📌 **Value**|
|---|---|
|**Equilibrium Price**|RM 2.00|
|**Equilibrium Quantity**|300 cones|
|**Market Status**|Balanced – No shortage or surplus|

> 📈 This occurs where the **demand curve intersects** the **supply curve** on a graph.

#### 🧠 **Why Equilibrium Matters in Health Economics**

Although healthcare markets **do not always behave competitively**, the concept of equilibrium still helps us understand:

- 💸 Price behavior in medicine and services
    
- 📦 Resource allocation
    
- 📉 What happens when interventions (e.g., subsidies, caps) distort market forces
    

> 📌 _Policymakers often intervene **when the market fails** to reach socially desirable outcomes._

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Market Equilibrium**|Quantity demanded = Quantity supplied at a specific price|
|**Surplus**|Price too high → More supply than demand|
|**Shortage**|Price too low → More demand than supply|
|**Adjustment**|Market forces **self-correct** via price signals|
|**Healthcare Implication**|Equilibrium helps explain and justify **policy responses**|

---

### 🔁 **Changes in Supply & Their Effect on Equilibrium**

#### 🌐 **Understanding Shifts in Supply and Their Market Impact**

In a competitive market, any change in **supply conditions** can **disrupt the existing equilibrium**, leading to new prices and quantities. This is a **dynamic process** where markets constantly adjust.

> 📌 When **supply increases or decreases**, the **supply curve shifts**, creating a **new intersection point** with the demand curve — thus setting a **new equilibrium**.

#### 📊 **Scenario: Ice Cream Cone Market**

Let’s break it down with the classic example from the lecture.

#### 🍦 Initial Market Conditions:

- **Original Supply Curve (S₁)** intersects with **Demand Curve (D)** at:
    
    - **Price** = RM2.00
        
    - **Quantity** = 300 cones  
        ✅ This is the **initial equilibrium**.
        

#### 📈 **Change: Increase in Supply**

Suppose supply increases due to external factors like:

- 📉 **Lower production costs** (e.g., cheaper milk, sugar, or labor)
    
- ⚙️ **Improved technology** or production efficiency
    
- 📦 **More suppliers** entering the market
    

➡️ This causes the **supply curve to shift right** ⏩ (from S₁ to S₂)

#### 📍 **New Equilibrium Outcomes**

|🧾 **Change**|💡 **Effect**|
|---|---|
|**Supply increases**|Supply curve shifts **right** (S₁ → S₂)|
|**At original price**|Quantity supplied **exceeds** quantity demanded → surplus|
|**Price adjusts down**|Surplus puts **downward pressure** on price|
|**New equilibrium**|Reached at a **lower price** and **higher quantity**|

> 📉 Consumers benefit from **lower prices**, and more cones are sold overall — improving access and affordability.

#### 🧠 **Economic Insight**

✅ This process reflects the **core principle of market adjustment**:

- Prices move to **balance quantity supplied and demanded**
    
- When supply rises, **prices fall** and **consumption increases**
    

> 📌 This is especially important in health economics where **changes in supply** (e.g., more clinics, new generics, cheaper diagnostics) can **improve access**—but also require careful **monitoring of quality and equity**.

#### 🎯 **Key Takeaways**

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Shift in Supply Curve**|Occurs due to external changes like cost reduction or tech improvements|
|**Rightward Shift**|Means **more is supplied** at every price level|
|**New Equilibrium**|Lower price, higher quantity|
|**Consumer Impact**|Better availability and affordability|
|**Health Sector Relevance**|Helps understand access to care, medicine pricing, and provider expansion|

### 🧵 **Supply Curve Under Perfect Competition**

#### ⚙️ **What Is a Supply Curve?**

The **supply curve** shows the relationship between the **price of a good** and the **quantity a seller is willing to supply**.

Under **perfect competition**, we analyze the supply curve at **two levels**:

- 👨‍🔧 The **individual firm**
    
- 🏙️ The **entire market**
    

#### 👨‍🔧 **Firm-Level Supply Curve (Micro View)**

In a perfectly competitive market:

- Each firm is **one of many** producing an identical product.
    
- Its **output is negligible** relative to the total market.
    
- Therefore, the firm is a **price taker** — it **cannot influence** the market price.
    

##### 🔄 Result:

- The firm faces a **perfectly elastic demand curve** at the **market price**.
    
- So, the **supply curve for an individual firm** is a **horizontal line** at the going price.
    

> 📌 This means the firm can **sell as much as it wants**, but only at the **market price** — not higher.

##### 📈 Visual Summary:

|Condition|Firm Behavior|
|---|---|
|Market price is RM2.00|Firm will supply any quantity **at RM2.00**|
|Firm tries to raise price|❌ No one buys from it—buyers switch to other sellers|
|Firm lowers price|❌ Makes no sense—buyers already willing at RM2.00|

#### 🏙️ **Market-Level Supply Curve (Macro View)**

While each firm’s supply curve is **horizontal**, the market supply curve is different.

- It reflects the **total quantity supplied** by **all firms** in the market at different price levels.
    
- As price increases, **more firms find it profitable to produce more** or **enter the market**.
    

##### 🔺 Result:

- The **market supply curve is upward-sloping**.
    

> 📌 It shows that **as prices rise**, the **total quantity supplied increases**—because more firms are willing and able to supply at higher prices.

#### 📊 **Comparison: Firm vs Market Supply Curve**

|Feature|Firm-Level Supply Curve|Market-Level Supply Curve|
|---|---|---|
|**Shape**|Horizontal ➖|Upward-sloping 📈|
|**Price Influence**|No influence (price taker)|Aggregate behavior influences price|
|**Relevance**|Individual decision-making|Macro-level market outcome|

#### 🧠 **Key Economic Insight**

In perfect competition:

- Individual firms **respond to price**, but **do not set it**.
    
- The **interaction of many firms** shapes the **market supply**, which then interacts with demand to determine equilibrium.
    

> 🧵 _The simplicity of the firm’s supply behavior contrasts with the dynamic aggregate supply of the market._

#### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

|Concept|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Firm-Level Supply Curve**|Horizontal at market price — reflects price-taking behavior|
|**Market Supply Curve**|Upward-sloping — as price rises, total quantity supplied increases|
|**Perfect Competition Context**|Firm output too small to impact price; market price determined by forces of supply and demand|

### 📚 **Summary of Core Concepts**

This section provides a **succinct wrap-up** of the foundational economic tools covered in the lecture. These tools form the backbone of economic reasoning and policy-making—especially in **healthcare systems** where resources are limited and trade-offs are unavoidable.

#### 📉 **Law of Demand**

> **"Ceteris paribus"** (all else being equal):

- When the **price of a good decreases**, the **quantity demanded increases**
    
- When the **price increases**, the **quantity demanded decreases**
    

🧠 **Key Insight**:

- This inverse relationship is foundational to understanding consumer behavior
    
- Explains how people **adjust their choices** based on affordability
    

#### 📈 **Law of Supply**

> Also under **ceteris paribus** conditions:

- When the **price of a good increases**, the **quantity supplied increases**
    
- When the **price decreases**, the **quantity supplied decreases**
    

🧠 **Key Insight**:

- Suppliers are motivated by **profit incentives**
    
- Higher prices attract **more production** or entry into the market
    

#### ⚖️ **Market Equilibrium**

> The point at which **quantity demanded equals quantity supplied**

📌 At this point:

- The **market clears**—no surplus or shortage
    
- Prices are **stable**
    
- Both buyers and sellers are **satisfied** with the quantity and price
    

🧠 **Key Insight**:

- Any deviation from equilibrium results in **market forces adjusting price and quantity** until balance is restored
    

#### 💯 **Perfect Competition**
