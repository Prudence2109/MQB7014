## 📋 **Executive Summary: Lecture 3 – Demand for Health and Health Care**

### 🧠 **Focus**
Understanding the economic principles behind how individuals **demand health and healthcare**, and how system-level mechanisms (like insurance and provider payment) influence behavior and cost.

### 🏥 **1. Production of Health**

- Health is treated as an **output**, produced through various **inputs**: biology, behavior, environment, socioeconomics, and healthcare.
    
- The **healthcare system** is only **one contributor** to population health—often **not the most important historically**.
    
- **Thomas McKeown’s thesis** argued that **improved living standards and nutrition** (not medical care) were the main drivers of mortality decline in 18th–20th century England.
    
- Modern studies show that **healthcare access has marginal benefits**, especially for older populations.
    

### 💊 **2. Demand for Health and Health Care**

- Demand for healthcare is **derived** from the **demand for health**, which itself stems from the **desire to maximize utility** (well-being).
    
- **Grossman’s model (1972)**: Individuals are both **consumers and producers of health**, treating health as a form of **human capital**.
    
- Health is a **capital good**:
    
    - It depreciates over time.
        
    - Can be maintained/improved through investment (e.g., rest, nutrition, medical care).
        
- Health decisions are modeled using **rational choice theory**, incorporating **uncertainty** via **expected utility theory**.
    

### ⚖️ **3. Provider Payment Mechanisms**

- The way providers are paid affects their behavior and service delivery.
    

|Payment Model|Incentives Created|
|---|---|
|**Capitation**|Fixed fee per patient → strong cost control but risk of under-provision or selection bias|
|**Salary**|Stable income → equitable access, but may reduce efficiency or motivation|
|**Global Budget**|Fixed total budget → strong cost containment, but potential for rationing and quality decline|

### ⚠️ **4. Moral Hazard and Third-Party Payers**

- **Insurance** removes the financial burden from patients, but may lead to **overuse of services**.
    
- This change in behavior is known as **moral hazard**.
    
- Evidence from the **RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE)** showed that insurance increases service use without proportional health gains.
    
- Moral hazard is more significant with **elastic demand** (e.g., minor illnesses) and less so with **inelastic demand** (e.g., insulin for diabetics).
    

#### 🛡️ **Strategies to Control Moral Hazard**

- Introducing **cost-sharing** helps curb overuse:
    

|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|**Copayment**|Fixed fee per visit/service|
|**Coinsurance**|Percentage of the cost paid by patient|
|**Deductible**|Minimum amount paid by patient before insurance kicks in|

- These mechanisms encourage **responsible utilization** and balance access with **financial sustainability**.
    

### 📌 **Key Takeaways**

- **Health is not synonymous with healthcare.**
    
- Individuals make **rational choices** about investing in their health, but the healthcare market has **unique features** (e.g., information asymmetry, externalities).
    
- **Provider payment models** and **insurance structures** significantly influence behavior, access, and cost.
    
- Designing effective health systems requires balancing:
    
    - Access
        
    - Efficiency
        
    - Cost containment
        
    - Equity

## 🔁 **Revision of Basic Economic Principles**

Before diving into the complex dynamics of health and health care demand, this section recaps **three foundational economic principles** that are essential for understanding market behavior in general—and later, how these apply uniquely to the healthcare sector.

---

### 📉 **1. Law of Demand**

> "**When the price falls, the quantity demanded rises.**"

#### 💡 Explanation:

- This fundamental economic law describes an **inverse relationship** between **price** and **quantity demanded**.
    
- It assumes **all other factors remain constant** (ceteris paribus).
    

#### 🧠 Why It Matters:

- Consumers respond to **lower prices** by increasing their demand for a good or service.
    
- Conversely, **higher prices** typically discourage consumption.
    

#### 📊 Visual Intuition (not shown in original slides, but helpful):

|Price ↓|Quantity Demanded ↑|
|---|---|
|RM10|100 units|
|RM5|180 units|

➡️ As price drops from RM10 to RM5, more consumers are willing and able to purchase the product.

---

### 📈 **2. Law of Supply**

> "**When the price increases, the quantity supplied rises.**"

#### 💡 Explanation:

- This law describes a **direct relationship** between **price** and **quantity supplied**.
    
- Again, it holds under the assumption of **ceteris paribus**.
    

#### 🧠 Why It Matters:

- Producers are incentivized to **produce more** of a good or service when the **price rises**, as it becomes more profitable.
    

#### 📊 Visual Intuition:

|Price ↑|Quantity Supplied ↑|
|---|---|
|RM5|80 units|
|RM10|150 units|

➡️ At higher prices, producers find it worthwhile to increase output, perhaps even entering the market.

---

### ⚖️ **3. Perfectly Competitive Market**

> "**Equilibrium point when goods supplied equal to goods demanded.**"

#### 💡 Explanation:

- A perfectly competitive market is a theoretical construct where:
    
    - There are **many buyers and sellers**.
        
    - **Identical (homogeneous) products** are traded.
        
    - **No single agent** can influence the market price.
        
    - There is **perfect information** and **easy entry/exit** from the market.
        
- In such a market, **supply and demand curves intersect** at the **equilibrium point**, where:
    
    - 🟢 **Quantity demanded = Quantity supplied**
        
    - 🔵 **Market clears** without surplus or shortage
        

#### ⚙️ Real-Life Implication:

- While the **healthcare sector deviates** from perfect competition (e.g., asymmetric information, limited suppliers, unique services), this concept provides the **baseline model** to compare and understand deviations.
    

---

### 🧠 Summary Table: Key Economic Laws

|Principle|Relationship|Behavior Described|
|---|---|---|
|**Law of Demand**|⬇ Price → ⬆ Demand|Consumers buy more when prices fall|
|**Law of Supply**|⬆ Price → ⬆ Supply|Producers supply more when prices increase|
|**Perfect Competition**|Demand = Supply|Market reaches equilibrium with no distortion|

---

### 📌 Why This Section Matters in Health Economics:

Understanding these fundamental principles is **crucial** before analyzing:

- Why patients **demand health care** (even when it's costly or hard to access),
    
- Why providers **choose to offer services** in certain ways,
    
- How markets function **differently in healthcare** (e.g., market failure, moral hazard, price insensitivity).
    

🔍 These insights will serve as **reference points** as the lecture explores how real-world healthcare systems **diverge** from these ideal economic models.

## 🕵🏻‍♂️ **Adam Smith’s Invisible Hand: Market Efficiency Without Intervention**

One of the most iconic concepts in classical economics, the **“Invisible Hand”** metaphor by **Adam Smith** plays a key role in supporting the idea of **free market economies**. It underpins why, under certain conditions, markets can operate **efficiently without central control**.

---

### 🌐 **Key Concept: Invisible Hand**

> “**The invisible hand of the market**” refers to the **self-regulating nature** of a free marketplace where individuals pursuing their own interests inadvertently contribute to overall economic well-being.

---

### 🔧 **Function of the Invisible Hand**

- Acts to **prevent market distortion** by ensuring:
    
    - Resources are **allocated efficiently**
        
    - Goods and services are produced in line with **consumer demand**
        
    - Prices are determined through **natural forces of supply and demand**
        
- No need for central planners or intervention as long as:
    
    - **Markets are competitive**
        
    - **Participants act rationally**
        
    - **Information is transparent**
        

---

### 📈 **Support for Free Market Economies**

- The invisible hand **justifies** the operation of a **free market** where:
    
    - Individuals act based on **self-interest**
        
    - Producers aim to **maximize profit**
        
    - Consumers aim to **maximize utility**
        
- The outcome: A **spontaneous order** that aligns personal interest with public benefit.
    

---

### ⚖️ **Implications for Health Economics**

While the invisible hand promotes **minimal intervention** in most markets, the healthcare sector is **not a perfect market** due to:

- **Asymmetric information** (patients ≠ doctors)
    
- **Externalities** (e.g. vaccination benefits to others)
    
- **Moral hazard** (insurance-related overuse)
    
- **Equity concerns** (everyone deserves access to care, not just those who can pay)
    

📌 Therefore, while the invisible hand offers a powerful theoretical foundation, its application in **healthcare** is **limited and must be critically evaluated**.

---

### 📚 Summary Table: Adam Smith's Invisible Hand

|🔍 Aspect|💡 Description|
|---|---|
|**Core Idea**|Free markets can regulate themselves|
|**Mechanism**|Individuals pursuing self-interest = social benefit|
|**Prevents**|Government overreach, market inefficiencies|
|**Assumptions**|Rational actors, perfect information, competition|
|**Limitations in Health**|Info asymmetry, externalities, moral hazard, equity concerns|

---

### 🧠 Thought to Reflect On:

> _"In health care, the invisible hand may sometimes need a guiding hand."_ 🤝

---

## 🧠 **Overview of Economic Theories: Contrasting Perspectives on the Market**

Economic theories evolve as attempts to explain and predict how societies allocate their **limited resources**. This section introduces four major schools of thought, each offering **a distinct lens** through which to view market behavior and **policy implications**—especially relevant in fields like health economics.

---

### 🏛️ **1. Classical Economics**

> “**The market keeps everyone alert through competition, so leave it alone.**”

#### 🔍 Core Beliefs:

- Founded by **Adam Smith**, this school champions the **laissez-faire** approach.
    
- Believes that **market forces naturally regulate** themselves.
    
- **Competition** is seen as the key mechanism to ensure:
    
    - Efficiency
        
    - Innovation
        
    - Optimal resource allocation
        

#### ⚙️ Policy Implication:

- **Minimal government intervention** is ideal.
    
- Let the **invisible hand** do its work.
    

---

### 🤓 **2. Neoclassical Economics**

> “**Individuals know what they are doing, so leave them alone—except when markets malfunction.**”

#### 🔍 Core Beliefs:

- Builds on classical economics but adds focus on **rational individual choice**.
    
- People are **utility maximizers**; firms are **profit maximizers**.
    
- Uses **mathematical models** and **marginal analysis**.
    

#### ⚠️ Acknowledges Market Failures:

- Unlike classical economists, neoclassicals **accept that intervention** may be needed when:
    
    - Information is asymmetric
        
    - Externalities exist
        
    - Public goods are involved
        
    - Monopolies distort the market
        

#### ⚙️ Policy Implication:

- Government should intervene **selectively**, only to correct **market failures**.
    

---

### 🔨 **3. Marxist Economics**

> “**Capitalism is a powerful vehicle for economic progress, but it will collapse, as private property ownership becomes an obstacle to further progress.**”

#### 🔍 Core Beliefs:

- Founded by **Karl Marx**, this school views capitalism as a system that:
    
    - Enables **economic development**
        
    - Simultaneously sows the seeds of its **own destruction**
        
- **Class struggle** between:
    
    - **Bourgeoisie** (owners of capital)
        
    - **Proletariat** (workers)
        

#### 🚩 Critique of Private Ownership:

- Believes **private property** leads to:
    
    - Wealth inequality
        
    - Exploitation of labor
        
    - Unsustainable economic disparities
        

#### ⚙️ Policy Implication:

- Advocates for **collective ownership** and **redistributive policies**.
    
- Envisions an eventual **transition to socialism**, then **communism**.
    

---

### 🧮 **4. Keynesian Economics**

> “**What is good for the individual may not be good for the economy.**”

#### 🔍 Core Beliefs:

- Proposed by **John Maynard Keynes** during the Great Depression.
    
- Argues that **aggregate demand** is the primary driver of the economy—not just individual choices.
    

#### 🔄 Micro ≠ Macro:

- Individual saving (good for the person) can **harm** the economy if everyone saves and **no one spends**.
    
- This is known as the **paradox of thrift**.
    

#### ⚙️ Policy Implication:

- Supports **active government intervention** to:
    
    - Stimulate demand (via spending)
        
    - Reduce unemployment
        
    - Stabilize economic cycles
        

---

### 🧠 Summary Table: Major Economic Schools of Thought

|🏷️ School of Thought|💡 Key Perspective|⚙️ Role of Government|
|---|---|---|
|**Classical**|Let competition regulate the market|Minimal intervention|
|**Neoclassical**|Rational individuals need markets—except when they fail|Conditional intervention|
|**Marxist**|Capitalism drives progress but will collapse due to inequality|Overhaul of the system; collective control|
|**Keynesian**|Individual choices don’t always serve the economy|Active fiscal intervention|

---

### 📌 Final Reflection

> 🧬 “Any subject studying human beings, including economics, has to be **humble concerning its predictive powers.**”

💬 This reminder is crucial—especially in **health economics**, where decisions affect real lives, and **behavioral complexity** can defy even the best models.

---

## 🗂️ **Lecture Content Structure: Mapping the Journey Ahead**

This section outlines the **main themes and flow** of the lecture, helping students frame their understanding of how **health economics principles** apply specifically to the **demand for health and healthcare services**.

The lecture is divided into **three major thematic components**, each building on the last to deepen your comprehension of health-related decision-making, resource allocation, and systemic implications. Let’s explore what each theme covers. 👇

---

### 🏥 **1. Production of Health**

This part addresses the **fundamental question**:

> “What determines health outcomes—and how much of that can be attributed to healthcare services?”

#### 🔍 Core Themes:

- Understanding **health as a product** resulting from various inputs.
    
- Exploring the **contribution of healthcare** to population health across history and over time.
    
- Drawing insights from historical studies like **McKeown’s Thesis**.
    

#### 🧠 Key Questions Discussed:

1. What are the **factors** that influence the production of health?
    
2. What is the **role and contribution** of healthcare in this production?
    
3. How has this role **changed over time**?
    

---

### 💊 **2. Demand for Health & Health Care**

This section focuses on how and why individuals **seek health** and **consume healthcare services**.

#### 🔍 Core Themes:

- Economic theories around **rational choice**, utility, and human capital investment.
    
- The concept that **demand for health care is derived from the demand for health**, which in turn is derived from the desire for **utility**.
    
- Introduction to **Michael Grossman's model**, where individuals act as both **producers and consumers** of health.
    

#### ⚖️ Key Economic Concepts:

- Rational decision-making under **uncertainty**
    
- The **special nature of health care markets**
    
- How **health capital** is produced and maintained
    

---

### ⚖️ **3. Factors Influencing Demand for Health Care**

In this final section, the lecture examines **how the structure of the health system and financing mechanisms influence both providers and patients**.

It is split into two main subsections:

---

#### 💰 **A. Provider Payment Mechanisms**

> “How we pay providers affects how they behave.”

This subsection explores:

- Various provider payment models:
    
    - **Fee-for-service**
        
    - **Per diem**
        
    - **Case-based**
        
    - **Capitation**
        
    - **Salary**
        
    - **Global budget**
        
- How each model creates **different incentives** for providers.
    
- Their impact on:
    
    - **Cost**
        
    - **Quality**
        
    - **Quantity of care**
        

🧠 The goal is to understand how financial incentives can either **improve or distort** healthcare delivery.

---

#### 🛡️ **B. Moral Hazard from Third-Party Payers**

> “What happens when patients don’t pay directly for care?”

This subsection unpacks:

- The concept of **moral hazard** in health insurance.
    
- How the **removal of financial risk** for patients affects their behavior.
    
- Mechanisms through which **overuse** or **misuse** of services may occur.
    
- Real-world examples such as:
    
    - The **RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE)**
        
    - Distinctions between **elastic vs. inelastic** demand
        

💡 It also explores **insurance design strategies** (e.g. **copayments**, **coinsurance**, **deductibles**) used to manage these risks.

---

### 📚 Summary Table: Lecture Structure at a Glance

|⚖️ 3. Influencing Demand|How do systems shape behavior?|Payment models, moral hazard, insurance, behavioral incentives|

---

### 🧭 Why This Structure Matters

Understanding this structure is like **reading a map before a journey**. It helps you:

- Anticipate **key learning outcomes**
    
- Understand the **flow of logic**
    
- Retain information better by **contextualizing** each part within the bigger picture
    

Each section is interlinked—starting with **what produces health**, moving to **how people demand it**, and finally to **how systems shape that demand**.

---

## 🧬 PART I: Production of Health

### 🔧 **Understanding Production in Health**

The lecture opens by applying core economic principles to health — viewing **health as a product** of multiple inputs. This approach emphasizes the need to understand **how health is produced**, and what factors contribute to improving it.

---

### ⚙️ **What Is 'Production' in Economic Terms?**

> In economics, **production** is the transformation of **inputs into outputs**.

#### 🎯 In the context of health:

- **Inputs** = resources and factors that affect health
    
- **Outputs** = health outcomes such as reduced disease, longer life expectancy, better quality of life
    

---

### 📥 **Inputs to Health Production**

- 🧑‍⚕️ Healthcare services: access, quality, and timeliness
    
- 🧬 Biological factors: genetics, age, sex
    
- 🏃‍♀️ Behavioral factors: lifestyle, diet, physical activity, smoking
    
- 🌿 Environmental factors: housing, clean air, sanitation
    
- 💰 Socioeconomic conditions: income, education, employment
    
- 🏛️ Public infrastructure: sanitation, water supply, roads
    

---

### 📤 **Outputs of Health Production**

- 🌡️ Lower morbidity and mortality
    
- 📈 Higher life expectancy
    
- 😊 Improved quality of life
    
- 💪 Greater resistance to diseases
    

---

### 💡 Why Is Health Viewed as a Production Process?

Understanding health as a production process allows for:

1. **Efficient Resource Allocation**  
    → Helps prioritize **scarce resources** toward impactful interventions
    
2. **Comparative Analysis of Interventions**  
    → Enables comparison of **alternative pathways** to improve health
    
3. **Evidence-Based Decision-Making**  
    → Informs **health policy** and public investment decisions
    

---

### ❓ Core Questions Explored in This Section

---

#### **1️⃣ What Are the Factors That Influence the Production of Health?**

Health is produced through a **complex mix of factors**, far beyond just hospitals or clinics:

- **Biological**: age, sex, genes
    
- **Behavioral**: exercise, smoking, alcohol intake
    
- **Environmental**: housing, pollution, sanitation
    
- **Socioeconomic**: income, education, work conditions
    
- **Healthcare**: services received, affordability, access
    

🧠 These inputs form what is known as a **“health production function”**.

---

#### **2️⃣ Specifically, What Is the Contribution of Health Care Towards the Production of Health?**

There’s a **common misconception** that healthcare is the **primary determinant of health**, but historical and empirical evidence challenges this.

Two types of contributions are considered:

- **Total contribution**: Overall long-term impact of healthcare on population health
    
- **Marginal contribution**: The additional impact of healthcare **when access improves** (especially relevant in modern contexts)
    

---

#### **3️⃣ Has This Contribution Changed Over Time?**

✅ **Yes** — and it continues to evolve:

- **Historically**:  
    Major health gains were largely due to **public health measures** and **better living standards** — _not_ advanced medical care.
    
- **Today**:  
    With chronic diseases and aging populations, healthcare plays a growing role in:
    
    - Extending life
        
    - Managing quality of life
        
    - Supporting palliative and preventive care
        

---

### 📚 **Case Study: McKeown’s Thesis**

A pivotal historical analysis that changed the way public health professionals view healthcare’s role in population health.

---

### 🧑‍🏫 **Who Was Thomas McKeown?**

A British physician and medical historian who asked:

> “Why did the population of England and Wales grow so dramatically between 1770 and the 20th century?”

---

### 📌 McKeown’s Key Conclusions

- 📉 **Population growth** was driven by **declines in mortality**, not:
    
    - Higher birth rates
        
    - Immigration
        
- 🦠 Mortality decline was **most significant** in infectious diseases like:
    
    - **Tuberculosis (TB)**
        
    - Bronchitis
        
    - Pneumonia
        
    - Influenza
        
- 🏥 Role of **medical technology** = **Minimal**
    
- 🧼 **Public health measures** (like immunisation and sanitation) played a role but were **not the primary driver**
    
- 🥗 The **most important factor** was the **rise in living standards**, which improved:
    
    - **Nutrition**
        
    - **Resistance to infection**
        

---

### 📉 Mortality from TB in England & Wales (1838–1970)

|Year|Event|
|---|---|
|1882|Koch identifies the **TB bacillus**|
|1947|Introduction of **streptomycin**|
|1953|Universal **BCG vaccination** for children|

👉 However, **TB mortality had been falling** **well before** any of these breakthroughs.

---

### 🧨 McKeown’s Thesis: Discredited?

Later research criticized McKeown for:

- Underestimating the role of **public health infrastructure**
    
- Overgeneralizing from limited data
    
- Overlooking the **synergy** between health systems and social improvements
    

🔍 Nevertheless, his work **sparked critical rethinking** about **overreliance on curative care**.

---

### 🩺 **Contemporary Perspective: What Is Health Care’s Contribution Today?**

#### **Total Contribution**:

Historically limited — curative care **wasn’t** the main reason for improved life expectancy.

#### **Marginal Contribution**:

Evidence shows **measurable benefits** when care is made **more accessible**, especially among older adults.

📊 **Study Insight – Hao et al. (2020), BMC Geriatrics:**

|Age Group|Added Life Expectancy (with adequate healthcare access)|
|---|---|
|65 years|**2.0–2.5 years**|
|85 years|**1.0–1.2 years**|

🩺 This proves that healthcare access **does matter**, especially in **later life**.

---

### 🧠 Summary Table: McKeown vs. Modern Perspective

|Perspective|Key Insight|Limitation|
|---|---|---|
|**McKeown**|Improved health = better **living standards**, not healthcare|Underestimated impact of **public health**|
|**Modern View**|Healthcare access improves **marginal outcomes**, esp. in elderly|Acknowledges **multi-factorial** health drivers|

---

## ✅ Key Takeaway

While **healthcare matters**, it's just **one piece of a larger puzzle**. Real health gains come from:

- **Investing in social determinants**
    
- **Public health infrastructure**
    
- **Ensuring equitable access to quality care**
    

🧭 This sets the stage for exploring why people demand healthcare, and what shapes their decisions — which is the focus of the next major section.

---

## 🧠 PART II: Demand for Health & Health Care

In this section, we shift the lens from **how health is produced** (Part I) to understanding **how and why people demand health and health care**. Here, the lecture builds on classical and behavioral economic principles to explain individual decision-making, the uniqueness of healthcare markets, and the pioneering framework introduced by Michael Grossman.

---

### 🧩 **Rational Decision-Making Framework**

In standard economic models, consumers are assumed to make **rational choices** based on available information, balancing costs against expected benefits.

#### 🔑 **Core Assumptions of Rational Decision-Making:**

1. **Ability to judge based on information**:
    
    - Considers both **monetary and non-monetary costs** (e.g. time, effort, discomfort).
        
    - Evaluates the **benefits of consumption** (e.g. improved health, relief, productivity).
        
2. **Costs and benefits are borne by the consumer**:
    
    - Consumers are **directly responsible** for the consequences of their decisions.
        
3. **Decision point**:
    
    - Decide **whether or not to consume**.
        
    - If choosing to consume, determine **how much** to consume.
        

---

### 📚 **Axioms of Consumer Choice Theory**

These form the **logical foundation** of rational decision-making:

|Axiom|Description|
|---|---|
|**Completeness**|Consumers can rank all options based on preference.|
|**Transitivity**|If A is preferred to B, and B to C, then A is preferred to C.|
|**Selection**|Consumers choose the most preferred option among all.|

---

### 🎲 **Expected Utility Theory: Enhancing the Framework**

This theory expands rational choice to include **decisions made under uncertainty** — especially relevant in healthcare.

#### 🔍 Additional Assumptions:

- **Risk assessment**: Consumers can judge the probability of outcomes.
    
- **Outcome-focused**: Decisions are made based on **expected utility**, not the process.
    
- **Separation of roles**:
    
    - Consumption (seeking healthcare)
        
    - Production (engaging in preventive behaviors, exercise, etc.)
        

---

### ⚠️ **Health Care: A Special Case of Economic Decision-Making**

The healthcare market **defies many standard assumptions** of economic theory due to its **unique characteristics**.

#### 🤹 Key Differences from Ordinary Goods:

- 📊 **Highly technical information**:
    
    - Consumers **cannot accurately assess** the quality or necessity of care.
        
    - Leads to **information asymmetry** between patients and providers.
        
- 🤝 **Interlinked roles**:
    
    - The **supplier (doctor)** often influences — or even **decides** — the consumer’s behavior.
        
    - This creates a **principal-agent relationship**:
        
        - **Principal** = patient
            
        - **Agent** = provider
            
        - Trust is essential, but misaligned incentives can distort demand.
            
- ⚖️ **Externalities**:
    
    - Healthcare affects not just individuals but also **society at large**.
        
    - Example: **Vaccination** protects the individual **and** the community.
        
- 🔄 **Utility from multiple sources**:
    
    - Satisfaction may come from:
        
        - **Achieving health**
            
        - **Equity in access**
            
        - **Avoiding the burden of decision-making**

## 📚 **Grossman’s Theory of Health Demand (1972)**

> 💡 _“Health is not just consumed — it is also produced by the individual.”_

Michael Grossman introduced one of the most influential frameworks for understanding the demand for health and health care.

---

### 👤 **The Individual as Both Consumer and Producer**

- **Consumers**: Seek health services to improve or maintain health.
    
- **Producers**: Engage in activities (e.g. exercising, eating well) that **create or preserve health**.
    

This concept brings health into the broader **theory of human capital** — like education, health is an **investment**.

---

### 💼 **Health as Human Capital**

- Just as we invest in education to improve **earning potential**, we invest in health to:
    
    - Increase **productivity** in the market (employment)
        
    - Improve our ability to function in the **non-market** sector (home, social roles)
        

---

### 🧠 **Key Concepts in Grossman’s Model**

1. **Derived Demand**:
    
    - People don’t want **healthcare** per se — they want **health**.
        
    - Healthcare is demanded **because it contributes to health**.
        
    - Health is demanded **because it contributes to utility**.
        
    
    🧩 Chain of Demand:  
    `Utility → Health → Health Care`
    
2. **Health as a Capital Good**:
    
    - It **lasts over time**.
        
    - Like all capital goods, it **depreciates** — at a **non-constant rate**.
        
    - Individuals must **invest in it continuously** to:
        
        - Offset depreciation (e.g. due to aging)
            
        - Improve future productivity and well-being

### 📦 Grossman’s Health Production Function

|Factor|Role in Health Production|
|---|---|
|**Time**|Used for rest, exercise, seeking care|
|**Money**|Spent on food, medicine, gym memberships, etc.|
|**Education**|Improves efficiency in producing health (e.g. better health literacy)|
|**Medical Care**|Supports recovery and chronic condition management|

---

### 📌 Why Grossman’s Theory Matters

- Highlights that **healthcare is not the end goal** — **health is**.
    
- Reinforces the importance of **individual behavior and investment** in achieving good health.
    
- Lays the groundwork for understanding **who demands care, when, and why** — essential for:
    
    - Policy design
        
    - Preventive health planning
        
    - Insurance modelling
        

---

### 🧠 Summary Table: Rational Decision-Making vs. Health Demand

|Dimension|Standard Goods|Health Care|
|---|---|---|
|Consumer Judgment|Clear & informed|Often lacks technical expertise|
|Supplier Role|Passive seller|Active influencer of demand|
|Utility Source|Direct from consumption|Indirect via improved health|
|Externalities|Rare|Common (e.g. herd immunity)|
|Capital Aspect|Typically consumables|Health is a capital good|

## 💸 PART III: Provider Payment Mechanisms

**How providers are paid** plays a powerful role in shaping their **incentives**, **clinical decision-making**, and **resource utilization**.

This section explores three major payment models:

- **Capitation**
    
- **Salary**
    
- **Global Budget**
    

Each comes with distinct **benefits**, **risks**, and **impacts** on care delivery.

---

### 💰 **Capitation**

#### 🧾 **Definition:**

A **capitation payment** model pays providers a **fixed amount** per patient for a specified period (e.g., per year), regardless of:

- How many services are provided
    
- How often the patient seeks care
    
- What specific treatments are delivered
    

🩺 It is designed to cover **all necessary care** within that timeframe.

#### 🏥 **Real-World Example:**

In the **United Kingdom**, **General Practitioners (GPs)** are paid by the **National Health Service (NHS)** using a capitation system.

---

#### 📊 **Potential Impacts of Capitation**

|✅ Positive Impacts|⚠️ Negative Impacts|
|---|---|
|Providers have a **strong incentive to contain costs** since they don’t get more money for providing more services|May result in **adverse selection**, where providers **avoid enrolling sicker patients** who are costlier to treat|
|Encourages a **preventive approach** — keeping patients healthy is cost-effective|Risk of **under-provision of care** if providers try to save money by limiting services|

🧠 **Bottom line:**  
Capitation promotes **efficiency and prevention**, but may encourage **cherry-picking** healthier patients unless regulated.

---

### 💼 **Salary**

#### 🧾 **Definition:**

Under the **salary model**, healthcare providers receive a **fixed monthly income**, **independent** of:

- The number of patients seen
    
- The quantity or quality of services provided
    

This model is commonly used in **public sector health systems**.

---

#### 📊 **Potential Impacts of Salary**

|✅ Positive Impacts|❌ Negative Impacts|
|---|---|
|Reduces the likelihood of **denying necessary care**, since income doesn't depend on workload|No incentive to **control costs**, which may lead to **overuse of resources**|
|Encourages **focus on quality**, not quantity|May reduce **productivity** — providers have no financial reward for seeing more patients or working more efficiently|

🧠 **Bottom line:**  
While salaried providers may offer **unbiased care**, the model risks **inefficiency and complacency** without performance monitoring.

---

### 🏥 **Global Budget**

#### 🧾 **Definition:**

In a **global budget system**, a healthcare institution (typically a hospital) receives a **fixed total amount** to cover **all its operations and services** over a set period — typically **one year**.

This budget is **not adjusted** for:

- The number of patients treated
    
- The complexity of services delivered
    

---

#### 📊 **Potential Impacts of Global Budgeting**

|✅ Positive Impacts|⚠️ Negative Impacts|
|---|---|
|Provides a **strong incentive to control costs** — hospitals must live within their budget|May **compromise quality of care** if cost-cutting measures become excessive|
|Encourages **institution-wide efficiency**, including managing staff and procurement|Could lead to **rationing of care** or **longer waiting times** if demand exceeds planned capacity|
|Enables **predictable financial planning** for health authorities|Hospitals might **avoid costly procedures or complex cases** to stay within budget|

🧠 **Bottom line:**  
Global budgets enforce **cost discipline**, but **must be balanced** with **monitoring of quality** and **access**.

---

### 🧾 Summary Table: Provider Payment Models

|Model|Description|Positive Incentives|Risks & Challenges|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Capitation**|Fixed payment per patient per period|Cost containment, prevention-focused|Adverse selection, under-provision|
|**Salary**|Fixed monthly income|Equal access, low denial risk|Low productivity, poor cost control|
|**Global Budget**|Fixed yearly hospital budget|System-wide cost discipline|Rationing, quality compromise|

---

### 📌 Why This Section Matters

How providers are paid affects **how they behave**:

- Which patients they accept 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
    
- How much time they spend 🕐
    
- Which treatments they choose 💊
    
- Whether they focus on **volume**, **cost**, or **value**
    

Understanding these models is **crucial for policymakers**, planners, and public health professionals tasked with designing **sustainable** and **equitable** healthcare systems.

## ⚠️ PART IV: Moral Hazard and Third-Party Payers

This section highlights one of the **most complex and consequential dynamics** in health economics: how **insurance and third-party payers** affect behavior—particularly the phenomenon known as **moral hazard**.

---

### 🛡️ **What is Insurance?**

Insurance in health care is designed to **protect individuals from the financial burden** of illness or injury by:

- 💵 Requiring **prepayment** into a **common risk pool** (e.g., monthly premiums).
    
- 🏥 Using that pooled fund to **pay providers** when covered individuals require care.
    
- 🛑 Acting as a buffer to **prevent catastrophic out-of-pocket spending**.
    

#### 🎯 Objective:

To **share risk** across a broad population, ensuring **financial access to care** when needed.

---

### 📉 **Financial Risk in Insurance**

Once insured, individuals are **shielded from the full cost** of healthcare services.

#### ⚙️ Key Shift:

- **Healthcare is no longer paid directly** by the patient.
    
- Instead, it's covered by **third-party payers**:
    
    - 🏢 Private insurance companies
        
    - 🏛️ Government agencies
        
    - 🧑‍💼 Employers
        

---

### 📌 This Financial Insulation Results In:

1. **Behavioral Change**:
    
    - Patients **consume more services** than they would if paying out of pocket.
        
2. **Rising Costs**:
    
    - Overall system expenditure increases due to **excess demand**.
        
3. ⚠️ A well-known phenomenon emerges:
    
    ### ❗ **Moral Hazard**
    

---

### ❗ What is Moral Hazard?

> **Moral hazard occurs when a person insulated from risk behaves differently than if fully exposed.**

#### 💡 In the context of healthcare:

- Patients **do not bear the full financial consequence** of their actions.
    
- This can lead to:
    
    - **Overutilization** of services
        
    - **Riskier behaviors**
        
    - **Inefficient use** of limited health resources
        

---

### 🧪 **The RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE)**

One of the **most influential studies** in health economics:

- Found that **insurance coverage increased** both:
    
    - The **utilization** of services
        
    - The **total cost** of care
        

📌 Even when services provided **minimal or no clinical benefit**.

---

### ⚙️ Mechanisms of Moral Hazard

Understanding **how** moral hazard arises is critical for designing better insurance models.

#### 🔄 Three Core Mechanisms:

1. **Behavioral Changes**
    
    - Individuals may engage in **riskier behaviors** (e.g., unsafe sex, excessive drinking, poor diet), knowing treatment is covered.
        
2. **Information Asymmetry**
    
    - Patients may **hide or underreport** health conditions to avoid being denied coverage or to get more benefits (e.g., not disclosing a prior heart attack).
        
3. **Decreased Out-of-Pocket Payments**
    
    - When patients don’t directly feel the cost, they have **less incentive to control usage**.
        
    - Particularly concerning when the **demand is elastic** (i.e., sensitive to price).
        

---

### 📉 Moral Hazard with **Inelastic Demand**

#### 🩸 **Example: Insulin for Type I Diabetes**

- Demand remains **constant**, even if price changes.
    
- Patients **must use insulin** regardless of cost.
    

✅ **Conclusion**:  
→ **No significant moral hazard**  
→ Consumption is **medically necessary and unavoidably consistent**

---

### 📈 Moral Hazard with **Elastic Demand**

#### 🤒 **Example: GP visits for mild fever**

- When insured, patient **pays nothing (RM0)** → demand **increases**
    
- Without insurance, cost may deter **non-essential visits**
    

|Scenario|Price Paid|Demand (Visits)|
|---|---|---|
|Without Insurance|P1|Q1|
|With Insurance|RM0|Q2 ↑|

💡 **Zero marginal cost** leads to **higher consumption** — even for conditions that may **self-resolve**.

---

## 📚 **Key Health Insurance Terminology**

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|**Premium**|Amount paid to obtain insurance coverage (usually monthly or yearly)|
|**Coverage**|The **range of services** or conditions that the insurance plan includes|
|**Cost Sharing**|Arrangement where both insurer and insured share medical costs|
|**Deductible**|A fixed amount the insured must pay **before** insurance starts paying|
|**Coinsurance**|A **percentage** of the total cost paid by the insured (e.g., 20%)|
|**Copayment**|A **fixed amount** paid by the insured per visit or service (e.g., RM20 per GP visit)|

---

## 👨‍💼 **Other Third-Party Payers**

Third-party payers aren’t limited to private insurance. They also include:

---

### 🏢 **Employers**

- Often provide **health benefits** as part of a compensation package.
    
- May:
    
    - Buy **group insurance** from private insurers.
        
    - **Self-insure** and pay claims directly.
        

⚠️ Still susceptible to **moral hazard**, especially when employees know their employer is footing the bill.

---

### 🏛️ **Government**

- Acts as both **funder and provider** of healthcare (e.g., MOH in Malaysia, NHS in the UK).
    
- Provides **universal or subsidized coverage**.
    

⚠️ Moral hazard exists here too — despite noble aims — especially if **utilization isn't monitored or regulated**.

---

## 🔒 **Mechanisms to Control Moral Hazard**

Even with third-party payers, **policy tools** exist to mitigate moral hazard.

#### ✅ Fundamental Principle:

> Ensure that **care is not entirely free** at the point of use.

---

### 🛠️ Common Tools to Encourage Responsible Utilization

|Mechanism|Description|
|---|---|
|**Copayment**|Fixed fee per service — discourages unnecessary visits|
|**Coinsurance**|Patients bear a **share of the cost** — encourages price awareness|
|**Deductible**|Ensures initial costs are borne by the patient — deters overuse|

🎯 These strategies aim to:

- Promote **prudent usage**
    
- Control **cost escalation**
    
- Reinforce **personal responsibility** without compromising access
    

---

## 🧠 Summary: Moral Hazard in Health Economics

|Aspect|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**What it is**|Behavioral change when individuals are insulated from the full cost of care|
|**Causes**|Insurance coverage, information asymmetry, reduced financial barriers|
|**Consequences**|Overuse of services, increased healthcare costs, inefficiencies|
|**Control Measures**|Copayments, coinsurance, deductibles|

---

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
Insurance provides **vital financial protection**, but if poorly designed, it can lead to **inefficient use** of healthcare resources. Thoughtful policy tools are essential to **balance access with sustainability**.
