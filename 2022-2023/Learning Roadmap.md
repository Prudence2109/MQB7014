# 📘 **Lecture 1: Introduction and Course Overview – MQB7014 Health Economics (MPH UM)**

---

## 🎯 **1. Purpose of the Lecture**

This foundational lecture lays the groundwork for understanding the **role of economics in health care**. It aims to:

- Introduce the **concept of economics** and how it applies to the **health sector**.
    
- Explain **why economic reasoning** is vital for making health decisions—whether for individuals, institutions, or national policies.
    
- Provide an overview of the **course structure and expectations** for MQB7014.
    

> 🌟 **Big Idea:** _Health economics helps us navigate the tension between **limited resources** and **unlimited health needs**._

---

## 🌍 **2. Global Relevance of Health Economics**

The lecture highlights how **global events like the COVID-19 pandemic** have emphasized the relevance of health economics:

- 📉 **Impact on Life Expectancy**: The pandemic led to sharp drops in life expectancy, even in well-resourced, high-income countries.
    
- 🔄 **Health Is Not Just Medical**: Outcomes depend on **how health resources are distributed**, not just biology or clinical decisions.
    
- ⚖️ **Trade-Offs Are Inevitable**:
    
    > Health systems must make **hard choices** because resources are **limited** but health needs are **infinite**.
    

### 📌 Therefore, **economic tools** help us:

- Allocate resources more **efficiently**.
    
- Set **priorities** and understand **opportunity costs**.
    
- Make better **policy and clinical decisions**.
    

---

## 🧠 **3. What Is Economics?**

> ✏️ _"Economics is the study of how people make choices under the condition of scarcity."_

### 💡 Key Takeaways:

- **Scarcity**: The central concept—resources are **not enough** to satisfy **all desires**.
    
- Because of this, people (and governments) are **forced to choose**.
    
- Economics helps analyze **which choices** are made and **why**.
    

### 🏥 **In Health Economics**, this means:

- Studying how health resources (e.g., money, manpower, technology) are **allocated**.
    
- Understanding the **outcomes and trade-offs** that result.
    

---

## 🏥 **4. Why Is Economics Relevant in Health?**

Healthcare isn't isolated—it competes for resources with sectors like:

- 🎓 **Education**
    
- 🛡️ **Defense**
    
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure**
    

### 🔍 Why it matters:

- 🚫 No system can **fund everything** → some **rationing is necessary**.
    
- 🎯 Every decision—whether it's about **new hospitals**, **treatment guidelines**, or **vaccine rollouts**—has **economic and ethical implications**.
    
- 🧭 Economics helps **navigate** these decisions.
    

---

## ⚙️ **5. What Makes Health Care Unique?**

Health care has **distinct features** that differentiate it from other sectors:

|🧩 **Feature**|📋 **Explanation**|
|---|---|
|⚠️ **Uncertainty**|Illness and treatment outcomes are **unpredictable**.|
|🧪 **Information Gap**|Patients often lack knowledge, relying on **health professionals’ expertise**.|
|🌐 **Externalities**|Health choices can affect others (e.g., **herd immunity** from vaccination).|
|🏥 **Limited Providers**|Especially in rural areas, care is provided by **monopolies or few providers**.|

> These features make **economic reasoning** more complex in health than in typical markets.

---

## 📘 **6. Definition of Health Economics**

> 📖 _"The study of how resources are allocated to and within the health economy."_

### 💡 Key Aspects:

- 💰 Focuses on **costs**, **efficiency**, and **impact**.
    
- ⚖️ Balances **economic logic** (e.g., utility, productivity) with **ethical concerns** (e.g., equity, fairness).
    
- 🧠 Equips decision-makers with tools to **optimize resource use** while being **socially responsible**.
    

---

## 🎯 **7. Core Learning Goals of the Module**

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

- 🧠 Develop **economic thinking** to analyze health problems.
    
- 🔄 Translate everyday observations into **macro-level insights**.
    
- ❓ Cultivate **critical inquiry and curiosity** about health systems.
    
- 🎓 Build a foundation for **policy evaluation and economic evaluation** in public health.
    

---

## 🔍 **8. Core Concepts Introduced**

These are the **building blocks** of health economics that were introduced in this session:

---

### 8.1 🧠 **Rational Behavior**

People are assumed to act **rationally**, meaning:

- They try to **maximize their utility** (i.e., satisfaction or benefit).
    
- Even health decisions involve a **cost-benefit calculation**.
    

---

### 8.2 ⚖️ **Cost-Benefit Principle**

> ✅ **A decision is rational if the benefit is greater than or equal to the cost.**

- Includes the **opportunity cost**:
    
    > _What you give up when you choose one option over another._
    

---

### 8.3 📉 **Marginal Thinking**

Rather than thinking in totals, economics often looks at **changes at the margin**:

- Should we **do one more** procedure?
    
- Should we **add one more nurse**?
    
- Should we **vaccinate one more child**?
    

---

## 🍈 **9. Case Study: Mr. Chan’s Durians**

This scenario illustrates **marginal analysis** and **diminishing returns**:

- 🧑‍🌾 Mr. Chan increases **fertilizer input** to grow more durians.
    
- Initially, this leads to more output.
    
- But over time, **each extra unit of fertilizer gives fewer additional durians**.
    

### 📌 Lesson:

> The **optimal input** occurs where:  
> ✅ **Marginal Benefit ≥ Marginal Cost**

---

## 📉 **10. The Law of Diminishing Returns**

> _"When one input increases while others stay constant, the extra output will eventually decrease."_

### 🏥 Application in Health:

- More money 💸 → more services 🏥 — but only up to a point.
    
- After a certain threshold, the **additional benefit drops**.
    
- Important when deciding how much to invest in **health programs, staff, or infrastructure**.
    

---

## 🧾 **11. Opportunity Cost in Student Life**

To make the idea of **opportunity cost** more relatable, the lecture uses an MPH student example:

### 📚 Imagine This:

You're a full-time student enrolled in the MPH program.

|💵 **Cost Item**|💡 **Explanation**|
|---|---|
|🎓 **Tuition Fees**|RM 800 per month|
|🏠 **Living Expenses**|RM 2,000 per month|
|💼 **Lost Income**|RM 2,000 per month (from leaving work)|

### 📊 **Total Opportunity Cost**

> RM 800 + RM 2,000 + RM 2,000 = **RM 4,800 per month**

🧠 **Insight**:  
You should only pursue this program if you believe the **value of what you gain** (skills, qualifications, future income) is **equal to or greater than RM 4,800/month**.

---

## ✅ **12. Final Takeaways: Tools of Economic Reasoning**

This section summarizes the **main economic principles introduced** and shows how they apply to real-life health decisions:

|🧠 **Concept**|🏥 **Health Sector Application**|
|---|---|
|🧭 **Rational Behavior**|Explains why patients or decision-makers choose one treatment or policy over another.|
|⚖️ **Cost-Benefit Analysis**|Helps answer: _Should we fund dialysis services or prevention programs?_|
|📉 **Marginal Thinking**|Helps decide: _Should we vaccinate one more child or hire one more nurse?_|
|🍃 **Diminishing Returns**|Tells us when adding more funds or staff stops producing meaningful improvements.|
|⌛ **Opportunity Cost**|Clarifies what we give up when we make a particular health investment or policy.|

> 🔍 **Key Insight**: These tools help us not just **analyze numbers**, but also make **value-driven decisions** in health systems.

---

## 🎓 **13. Conclusion: What This Lecture Sets in Motion**

This lecture lays the foundation for the rest of the module, introducing you to:

- The **economic mindset** necessary to evaluate health systems.
    
- How to think **strategically** and **critically** about health spending, priorities, and policies.
    
- Why health economics is about **more than money**—it’s about:
    
    - ⚖️ Fairness
        
    - 🔁 Trade-offs
        
    - 🌍 Real-world impact
        

> 🎓 **Goal of MQB7014**: To **equip future public health professionals** with the **tools and mindset** to make **better health decisions** at all levels—personal, institutional, and national.

---

### 🧠✨ Final Words:

> _Health economics teaches us that **every health choice** involves not only a cost, but also a **trade-off**—and understanding that is the first step toward smarter, more just, and impactful health systems._

---

# 📘 **Lecture 2: Basic Economic Tools – MQB7014 Health Economics (MPH UM)**

---

## 🎯 **1. Objective of the Lecture**

This lecture introduces the **core analytical tools** used in economics—essential for understanding how health systems behave under constraints. It equips students with a clear foundation to:

- Analyze **demand and supply** patterns
    
- Understand **pricing behavior**
    
- Evaluate **market responses** in the context of healthcare
    
- Apply these tools to **real-life policy and planning** in the health sector
    

> 💡 These tools are not just academic—they help public health professionals **make smarter decisions** in complex, resource-limited environments.

---

## 🔁 **2. Recap from Lecture 1: Rational Decision-Making & Marginal Analysis**

- 🧠 **Rationality** assumes individuals aim to **maximize their utility** (i.e., satisfaction) within the limits of their **scarce resources**.
    
- ⚖️ Decisions are assessed **at the margin**, i.e., through **marginal cost vs. marginal benefit** comparisons.
    

> 🎯 In health: Should we hire one more nurse? Add one more MRI machine? The **marginal analysis** helps us decide.

---

## 💎 **3. Measuring Utility and Value**

Utility cannot be observed directly, but it can be **inferred from choices** people make—especially their **willingness to pay (WTP)**.

### 💡 Classic Example: **Diamond-Water Paradox**

|🟦 **Item**|💧 Water|💎 Diamond|
|---|---|---|
|❗ Essentiality|Extremely high|Low|
|💲 Market Price|Very low|Extremely high|
|🔍 Why?|Because price is driven by **scarcity** and **marginal utility**, not total usefulness||

> 🧠 **Insight**: We don't pay for how vital something is overall, but **how much more benefit** we get from one additional unit.

---

## 📉 **4. Demand Dynamics**

### 📜 **Law of Demand**

> When **price increases**, the **quantity demanded decreases**—holding other factors constant.

- This is an **inverse relationship** between price and demand.
    

### 🔄 **Demand Function Is Influenced By**:

- 🔺 **Price** of the good
    
- 💰 **Consumer income**
    
- 💖 **Preferences and tastes**
    
- 🛒 **Prices of related goods** (substitutes & complements)
    

---

### 🔄 Movement vs. Shift of Demand Curve

|📌 **Change**|🎯 **Effect**|
|---|---|
|🔺 Change in price|Movement **along** the curve|
|🔁 Change in other determinants (e.g., income)|**Shift** of the entire curve|

> 📊 A rightward shift = **more demand** at every price; a leftward shift = **less demand**.

---

## 📊 **5. Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**

### 📏 Definition:

> Measures how **responsive quantity demanded is** to a change in price.

|📐 **Elasticity Type**|💬 **Interpretation**|
|---|---|
|**PED > 1**|**Elastic** – demand changes a lot with price|
|**PED < 1**|**Inelastic** – demand changes little with price|
|**PED = 1**|**Unit elastic** – proportional response|

### 🏥 Application in Healthcare:

- 💸 **Cost-sharing policies** (e.g., copayments) affect service use depending on **demand elasticity**.
    
- Policymakers must be cautious: Even **small fees** can deter essential care in **price-sensitive populations**.
    

---

## 🔄 **6. Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED)**

### 📏 Definition:

> Measures how the **demand for one good** responds to the **price change of another**.

|🔍 **CED Value**|💬 **Relationship Between Goods**|
|---|---|
|**Positive**|**Substitutes** (e.g., branded vs. generic drugs)|
|**Negative**|**Complements** (e.g., syringes and insulin)|
|**Zero**|**Independent** goods|

---

## 🌍 **7. Health Sector Case Studies**

### 📘 Example 1: **RAND Health Insurance Experiment (USA)**

- Studied the effect of **cost-sharing** on healthcare use.
    
- Showed **lower utilization** when patients faced **higher out-of-pocket costs**.
    

### 📘 Example 2: **Burkina Faso Study**

- In extremely poor areas, **demand was price-inelastic**, but this was **not an argument for higher prices**.
    
- ⚠️ **Caution**: Low elasticity in impoverished settings may reflect **lack of alternatives** or **desperation**, not true indifference to cost.
    

> 🚨 Policymakers should **not misuse elasticity data** to justify price hikes in underserved areas.

---

## 📦 **8. Supply Dynamics**

### 📜 **Law of Supply**

> When **price increases**, the **quantity supplied increases**—assuming other factors constant.

### 📈 Factors That Influence Supply:

- 💰 **Price of the product**
    
- 🛠️ **Cost of production** (e.g., staff salaries, medication ingredients)
    
- 💡 **Technology and innovation**
    

---

### 🔁 Shifts in the Supply Curve

|🔄 **Cause**|📈 **Effect**|
|---|---|
|🔺 Cost ↑|Supply curve shifts **left** (less supply at every price)|
|🔻 Cost ↓ or tech improves|Curve shifts **right** (more supply)|

---

## ⚖️ **9. Market Equilibrium**

### 🔄 **Definition**:

> Occurs where **quantity demanded equals quantity supplied**.

- If **demand > supply** → **Shortage** → prices tend to rise
    
- If **supply > demand** → **Surplus** → prices tend to fall
    

> 🎯 Equilibrium is where **markets clear**—no pressure for prices to move.

---

## 🧩 **10. Market Structures**

Understanding different **market types** is key to analyzing healthcare systems.

|🏛️ **Market Type**|🔍 **Features**|
|---|---|
|**Monopoly**|One seller dominates (e.g., patented drug)|
|**Oligopoly**|Few sellers (e.g., pharmaceutical industry)|
|**Monopolistic Competition**|Many sellers with slightly differentiated products|
|**Perfect Competition**|Many sellers, identical products, full information|
|**Monopsony**|One buyer (e.g., Ministry of Health purchasing vaccines)|

> 🧠 **Perfect competition** is the economist’s ideal—but almost **never exists in health care** due to information gaps, regulation, and ethical concerns.

---

## 🏥 **11. Relevance to Health Economics**

While standard economic principles provide a **framework**, real-world healthcare markets are **far from perfect**. Here's why understanding these tools is especially important in the health sector:

### ⚠️ Unique Features of Health Markets

- 🔍 **Information Asymmetry**  
    → Patients rely heavily on **doctors’ expertise** and may lack the knowledge to make informed choices.
    
- 🌐 **Externalities**  
    → One person’s health decision (e.g., vaccination) can have **spillover effects** on the entire population.
    
- ⚖️ **Equity Concerns**  
    → Health is often seen as a **basic right**, so market-driven distribution can **exacerbate inequalities**.
    

### 🛠️ Economic Tools in Action:

|🧠 **Tool**|⚕️ **Use in Health Economics**|
|---|---|
|**Demand and Supply**|Helps analyze **utilization trends** and **resource availability**|
|**Elasticity Concepts**|Used to predict effects of **pricing**, **subsidies**, or **insurance policies**|
|**Market Structures**|Helps assess **efficiency, competition**, and **regulation needs** in pharmaceuticals, hospitals, etc.|
|**Equilibrium Analysis**|Used to determine the **natural price and quantity** where health services stabilize|

> 💡 These concepts enable policymakers to **spot inefficiencies**, design **better health financing mechanisms**, and **justify interventions**.

---

## 🎓 **12. Conclusion: Why These Tools Matter**

This lecture lays the **analytical foundation** for the rest of the course. With a strong grasp of **basic economic tools**, students can:

- 🔍 **Diagnose inefficiencies** in healthcare systems
    
- 📊 **Predict impacts** of health policies (e.g., co-payments, subsidies)
    
- 💬 **Advocate** for equitable, cost-effective resource distribution
    

> 🎯 **Health economics** is not just about cost—it’s about using the **language of trade-offs** to make **smarter, fairer decisions**.

---

### 🌟 **Final Thought: Economics in Health Is About...**

- 💭 **Thinking at the margin**
    
- ⚖️ **Balancing costs and benefits**
    
- 🧠 **Navigating constraints**
    
- 💖 **Centering values and impact**
    

> _“In a world of finite resources and infinite needs, economics helps us prioritize, strategize, and humanize our health decisions.”_

---

# 🧠💼 **Health Economics in Action: Synthesis of Lecture 1 & 2**

---

## 🎯 **The Big Picture: Why Health Economics?**

Lecture 1 sets the stage by asking a fundamental question:

> _In a world of scarce resources and unlimited health needs, how do we make the best decisions for individuals and society?_

Lecture 2 then equips us with **the economic toolkit** to answer this question.

Together, these lectures teach us that **health economics is not just about cost—it’s about choices, trade-offs, and impact.**

---

## 🧩 **Building Blocks of Economic Thinking in Health**

### From Lecture 1:

- **Scarcity** is the core issue → we must make **choices**
    
- **Opportunity cost** helps us weigh what we’re giving up when we choose one option over another
    
- **Marginal thinking** allows us to evaluate small, incremental decisions
    
- Health systems must **prioritize** because **no system can do everything**
    

### From Lecture 2:

- Economic **tools** like demand, supply, and elasticity give us a way to **analyze** those choices
    
- We measure how **price, income, and preferences** affect health service use
    
- Concepts like **equilibrium** and **market structure** help us understand **how health markets behave** and where they fail
    
- Elasticity and cross-elasticity show us the **real-world impact of pricing, subsidies, and alternatives** in health
    

> 🔄 **Together**: These principles and tools form a **decision-making framework** grounded in logic, ethics, and measurable outcomes.

---

## 🧠💸 **From Intuition to Policy Insight**

|🧠 **Conceptual Mindset (L1)**|🛠️ **Applied Tool (L2)**|💬 **Health Application**|
|---|---|---|
|Scarcity of resources|Demand & Supply|Budget allocation, resource planning|
|Marginal analysis|Marginal cost-benefit|Should we fund one more ICU bed?|
|Opportunity cost|Real-world costing|Value of MPH education vs. salary forgone|
|Rational behavior|Utility & willingness to pay|Health-seeking decisions|
|Economic values|Price elasticity|Designing co-payments & subsidies|
|Ethical trade-offs|Market structures|Monopoly pricing vs. equity in access|

> 🧭 Health economics is the bridge between **what should be done** and **what can be done wisely**—based on **data, models, and reasoning**.

---

## ⚕️💰 **Health Care: Not Just Another Market**

Lecture 1 reminded us that **healthcare is different** from other markets because of:

- ⚠️ **Uncertainty** (in outcomes)
    
- 🧪 **Information gaps** (patients can’t judge quality)
    
- 🌐 **Externalities** (vaccines help more than just the individual)
    
- 🏥 **Provider monopolies** (especially in rural areas)
    

Lecture 2 builds on this by showing how **real markets** work—and where they **fail** in healthcare:

- Perfect competition is rare
    
- Monopolies, monopsonies, and asymmetries distort outcomes
    
- Price and demand do not behave “normally” when people’s **lives and wellbeing** are at stake
    

> 📢 So, while economic tools offer structure, **ethical judgment and public values** must guide health decisions.

---

## 📊🧩 **Why This Synergy Matters in Policy and Practice**

This integration of Lectures 1 and 2 empowers public health professionals to:

- 🔍 **Diagnose inefficiencies** in health systems
    
- 📈 **Design better interventions** using cost-effectiveness and equity analysis
    
- 🧮 **Use data to predict** how people respond to price or access changes
    
- ⚖️ **Advocate wisely** for fairer, more efficient health policies
    

For example:

- Should the government **subsidize insulin**? → Use **PED** to analyze responsiveness
    
- Should we **invest more in prevention** or **dialysis**? → Use **opportunity cost and marginal benefit**
    
- How do we ensure fair access in **rural areas** with monopolistic care? → Examine **market structure** and equity
    

> 🧠 These aren’t just academic questions—they're **real-world dilemmas** you’ll face as future public health leaders.

---

## 🌟 **Final Synthesis: Economics with Heart and Strategy**

💬 **Health Economics = Economic Intelligence + Human Values**

It helps us:

- Think clearly under pressure
    
- Prioritize fairly under constraint
    
- Advocate with both **evidence** and **empathy**
    

> “To lead in public health, you must speak both the **language of budgets** and the **language of justice**—health economics teaches you both.”

---

# 📘 **Lecture 3: Demand for Health and Health Care – MQB7014 Health Economics (MPH UM)**

---

## 🧠 **Focus of the Lecture**

This lecture dives into the **economic principles** behind how individuals **demand health and healthcare**. It also explores how **provider payment systems** and **health insurance structures** shape both **behavior** and **costs** in the health system.

> 🎯 The goal is to understand the economic forces driving health-seeking behaviors and how system-level mechanisms can improve—or distort—health outcomes and efficiency.

---

## 🏥 **1. Health as a Product: The Production of Health**

Health is seen through an **economic lens** as something that can be **produced** using various inputs.

### 🧱 **Inputs That “Produce” Health**:

- **Biological factors** (genetics, age)
    
- **Behaviors** (smoking, exercise, diet)
    
- **Environment** (housing, sanitation, pollution)
    
- **Socioeconomic status** (education, income, employment)
    
- **Healthcare services** (doctors, hospitals, medicines)
    

> 💡 **Healthcare is just one part** of the health equation—and **not always the most impactful**.

### 🧬 **Historical Insight – McKeown’s Thesis**:

- Argued that the major decline in mortality in **18th–20th century England** was due to:
    
    - 🥗 Improved **nutrition**
        
    - 🧼 Better **living standards**
        
    - 🚰 Public health measures  
        → **Not** medical care.
        

### 📊 **Modern Findings**:

- While **access to healthcare** does matter, its benefits are often **marginal**, especially in aging populations.
    
- Health outcomes often depend more on **social determinants** than clinical intervention.
    

---

## 💊 **2. Demand for Health vs. Demand for Healthcare**

### 🔁 **Derived Demand**:

- People don’t value **healthcare** for its own sake.
    
- They value it because it helps them achieve something deeper: **health**, which in turn supports **utility (well-being, productivity, longevity).**
    

### 📚 **Grossman’s Model (1972)**:

A foundational framework in health economics where:

- Individuals are both:
    
    - **Consumers** of health (they enjoy being healthy)
        
    - **Producers** of health (they invest effort/resources to stay healthy)
        

### 💡 **Key Ideas from Grossman’s Model**:

|💬 **Concept**|📌 **Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**Health as Human Capital**|Just like education or skills, health enables productivity and enjoyment of life|
|**Health Depreciates Over Time**|Like machines, our health wears down without care|
|**Health Can Be Reinvested In**|Through good habits, rest, nutrition, and medical care|

### 🔍 **Decision-Making Framework**:

- Health decisions are modeled with **rational choice theory**.
    
- Incorporates **uncertainty** using **expected utility theory**:
    
    - People choose actions that give them the **highest expected satisfaction**, even in uncertain situations (e.g., treatment outcomes).
        

---

## ⚖️ **3. Provider Payment Mechanisms**

How providers are paid influences **how they behave**, what services they offer, and how efficiently resources are used.

### 💼 **Common Payment Mechanisms & Their Effects**:

|💳 **Payment Model**|🎯 **Incentives Created**|
|---|---|
|**Capitation** (💰 per patient)|Encourages **cost control**, but risks **under-provision** and **patient selection bias**|
|**Salary**|Promotes **stable service** and **equity**, but may reduce **productivity and innovation**|
|**Global Budget**|Strong **cost containment**, but can result in **rationing** and **quality decline** if mismanaged|

> ⚠️ Payment systems are not neutral—they **shape the healthcare ecosystem** and must be aligned with **policy goals**.

---

## 🚨 **4. Moral Hazard and Third-Party Payers**

### 🧾 **The Problem with Insurance**:

- When people **don’t directly pay** for their care, they may **consume more than necessary**.
    
- This is known as **moral hazard**.
    

### 📊 **RAND Health Insurance Experiment (HIE)**:

- Showed that **more generous insurance** → **increased service use**
    
- But this didn’t always lead to **better health outcomes**, especially for minor ailments
    

> 💡 **Conclusion**: Insurance can cause **overuse**, especially for services with **elastic demand**.

### 📈 **When Moral Hazard Is More Likely**:

|📉 **High Elasticity**|📈 **Low Elasticity**|
|---|---|
|Minor illnesses, optional check-ups|Life-saving meds (e.g., insulin), emergency care|

---

### 🛡️ **5. Strategies to Control Moral Hazard**

Cost-sharing mechanisms are used to **align patient behavior** with efficient resource use, while maintaining access.

|💸 **Tool**|🧾 **Description**|
|---|---|
|**Copayment**|Fixed fee per visit/service (e.g., RM10 per GP visit)|
|**Coinsurance**|Patient pays a % of the bill (e.g., 20% of cost)|
|**Deductible**|Minimum amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance starts covering|

> 🧠 These tools **discourage unnecessary care** while **preserving access** for serious health needs.

---

## 📌 **Key Takeaways from Lecture 3**

- 🧬 **Health is an outcome**, not a service—so policies must focus beyond just healthcare.
    
- 🧠 Individuals are **rational** and make trade-offs when investing in their health.
    
- 💳 **Provider payment models** shape how care is delivered—getting these wrong can waste resources or hurt quality.
    
- 🚨 **Moral hazard** must be controlled through smart **insurance design**—not by denying access, but by promoting **responsible use**.
    

---

## ⚖️ **Designing Effective Health Systems Requires Balance**

|⚙️ **Objective**|⚖️ **Challenge**|
|---|---|
|**Access**|Ensuring everyone can receive care|
|**Efficiency**|Avoiding wasteful use of services|
|**Cost Containment**|Preventing unsustainable health spending|
|**Equity**|Guaranteeing fairness, not just affordability|

> 🌟 Health economics teaches us that good system design is about **nudging behavior wisely**, not just controlling costs or expanding coverage.

---

## 🩺 **3. Lecture 3: Understanding Behavior – Why People Demand Health and Care**

### 🎯 Key Ideas:

- Introduced the **Grossman model**:
    
    - Individuals are both **producers** and **consumers** of health.
        
    - Health is treated as a **form of capital** that depreciates and can be reinvested in.
        
- **Healthcare demand is derived** from the more fundamental desire for **health and utility**.
    
- Explored how **provider payment methods** and **insurance** influence behavior:
    
    - 💸 Capitation, salary, and global budgets shape **provider incentives**.
        
    - 🛡️ Insurance introduces **moral hazard** → people may overconsume because they don’t bear the full cost.
        

> 🧠 Health-seeking behavior is **rational but shaped by structures**—and system design affects both efficiency and fairness.

## 🧩 **How the Three Lectures Complement Each Other**

|🧠 **Conceptual Foundation (L1)**|🛠️ **Analytical Tools (L2)**|🧍‍♀️ **Behavioral Application (L3)**|
|---|---|---|
|Scarcity & Trade-offs|Demand, Supply, Elasticity|Grossman model, Expected Utility|
|Marginal analysis|Marginal cost/benefit curves|Investment in health over time|
|Opportunity cost|Market responses & choices|Cost of not investing in health|
|Efficiency vs Equity tension|Market structure & failure|Impact of provider payment systems|
|Rational decision-making|Cost-benefit tools|Patient/provider choices in real life|
|Policy implications|Supply-demand shifts|Insurance design & moral hazard|

> 🌐 **Together**, they provide a **multi-level perspective**—from abstract principles to real-world systems and individual behaviors.

## 🧠💡 **Strategic Insights Gained Across Lectures 1–3**

|🔍 **Insight**|📌 **Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**Health ≠ Healthcare**|Health is shaped by broader determinants like behavior, environment, and socioeconomic status. Healthcare is only one input.|
|**People are rational, but constrained**|Decisions about health are made to maximize well-being—but under conditions of uncertainty, cost, and information gaps.|
|**Systems shape behavior**|How we pay providers and design insurance affects how both patients and professionals behave.|
|**Economic tools help clarify choices**|Elasticity, demand, and cost-benefit analysis help predict how people and markets respond to change.|
|**Equity, efficiency, and ethics must be balanced**|Economics helps us quantify trade-offs, but public health must guide them with values.|

## 🔄 **What This Foundation Prepares You For**

From here onward in the module, you’ll build on these insights to:

- 🧾 Evaluate **economic efficiency** of health programs (cost-effectiveness, cost-utility)
    
- 📊 Analyze **health financing mechanisms** (insurance, subsidies, tax-funded systems)
    
- 🛠️ Design **policy interventions** grounded in economic logic and public health values
    
- 📚 Tackle real-world problems—e.g., How do we price vaccines? How do we budget for aging populations?

## 💬 **Final Synthesis Quote**

> _“To lead in public health, we must understand not only what is right, but what is possible—and use economic reasoning to close the gap between the two.”_
