## 📝 Executive Summary

This lecture equips students with the tools to make **evidence-informed decisions** in resource-constrained health systems. It covers the **definition**, **types**, **economic principles**, **perspectives**, and **optimal timing** of economic evaluation, emphasizing its role in addressing **scarcity**, ensuring **efficiency**, and promoting **equity** and **transparency**. 

### 🌟 Overview and Importance

**Economic evaluation** is defined as a **comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences** (Drummond et al., 2005). It is a **central tool** in health economics, going beyond cost accounting to assess **value for money** for interventions like drugs, devices, programs, services, and policies. The lecture highlights the universal challenge of **scarcity**—**infinite health needs** versus **finite resources** (money, staff, time, infrastructure)—which forces health systems, including Malaysia’s, to make tough choices. Economic evaluation addresses this by enabling **rational**, **transparent**, and **efficient** resource allocation, supporting decisions at **national**, **state**, and **facility** levels. It ensures **transparency**, **accountability**, and **equity**, aligning with goals like **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)** and **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)**.

### 📋 Types of Economic Evaluation

The lecture introduces **four main types** of economic evaluation, each with distinct **outcome measures** and **decision focuses**:

|Type|Outcome Measure|Decision Focus|Key Limitation|
|---|---|---|---|
|**CMA (Cost-Minimization Analysis)**|Same outcome|Which is cheaper?|Rare in practice due to need for identical outcomes|
|**CEA (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis)**|Natural units (e.g., life years gained, cases detected)|Which gives more health for the cost?|Doesn’t value quality of life|
|**CUA (Cost-Utility Analysis)**|Utility-based (e.g., QALYs, DALYs)|Which gives more value considering quality of life?|Requires utility data|
|**CBA (Cost-Benefit Analysis)**|Monetary value (RM)|Do benefits exceed costs?|Ethically/methodologically controversial to monetize outcomes|

- **CMA**: Used when interventions have **identical outcomes**, focusing solely on cost differences (e.g., choosing between bioequivalent drugs).
- **CEA**: Measures outcomes in **natural units**, using the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**:  
    $$ICER = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta E} $$  
    where $\Delta C$ is the cost difference and $\Delta E$ is the effectiveness difference (e.g., RM50,000 per life year gained).
- **CUA**: Incorporates **quality of life** using **QALYs** (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) or **DALYs** (Disability-Adjusted Life Years), recommended for HTA (e.g., RM100,000/QALY).
- **CBA**: Converts outcomes to **monetary values**, enabling cross-sector comparisons but raising ethical challenges.

The lecture also distinguishes **partial evaluations** (single intervention analysis) from **full evaluations** (comparing multiple alternatives), emphasizing the latter’s robustness.

### 🧠 Key Economic Concepts

Four **core economic concepts** underpin economic evaluation:

- **Opportunity Cost**: The **value of the next best alternative forgone** (e.g., funding a cancer drug vs. ICU beds).
- **Scarcity**: **Limited resources** (money, staff, time) versus **unlimited health needs**, necessitating prioritization.
- **Efficiency**: Maximizing health benefits through **technical efficiency** (lowest cost for output, e.g., generic drugs) and **allocative efficiency** (maximizing population health, e.g., vaccinations).
- **Marginal Analysis**: Assessing **incremental costs and benefits** of small changes, using ICER to evaluate additional investments.

These concepts ensure **value-driven** decisions, focusing on health outcomes rather than just costs.

### 👀 Perspective in Evaluation

The **perspective** defines **whose costs and benefits** are included, shaping the evaluation’s scope:

|Perspective|Includes|Used By|
|---|---|---|
|**Societal**|All costs (direct, indirect, intangible)|Academics, global health|
|**Health System/Provider**|Medical costs only (e.g., hospital stays, drugs)|Ministries, hospitals|
|**Payer**|Costs to insurers/government schemes|Insurance companies, governments|
|**Patient**|Out-of-pocket and indirect costs|Equity studies, patient advocacy|

- **Societal**: Comprehensive, capturing **total societal impact** but data-intensive.
- **Health System**: Focuses on **medical costs**, suitable for budget planning (e.g., MaHTAS submissions).
- **Payer**: Includes **reimbursed costs**, relevant for programs like **MySalam**.
- **Patient**: Emphasizes **individual burdens**, critical for **equity** and **catastrophic health spending** analyses.

The choice of perspective can lead to **different conclusions** for the same intervention (e.g., a breast cancer therapy may be cost-effective societally but financially toxic for patients).

### ⏰ Timing of Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluation is most effective when **timely** and **purpose-driven**, aligned with **decision points** in planning or budgeting. It is valuable in:

- **Introducing new interventions** (e.g., new cancer therapy).
- **Scaling programs** (e.g., HPV vaccination expansion).
- **Choosing alternatives** (e.g., telehealth vs. outpatient visits).
- **Budget allocation** (e.g., dialysis vs. diabetes screening).
- **Addressing efficiency concerns** (e.g., re-evaluating screening guidelines).

Evaluations should be **avoided** when outcomes are **uncertain**, costs are **trivial**, or interventions are **not scalable**.

### 🧠 Key Terminologies Introduced

- **Economic Evaluation**: Comparative analysis of costs and consequences.
- **Value for Money**: Maximizing health benefits per unit of cost.
- **Scarcity**: Limited resources versus unlimited health needs.
- **Opportunity Cost**: Value of foregone alternatives.
- **Efficiency**: **Technical** (lowest cost for output) and **allocative** (maximizing population health).
- **Marginal Analysis**: Assessing incremental costs and benefits.
- **ICER**: Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio, measuring cost per additional outcome unit.
- **QALYs/DALYs**: Utility-based measures for quality and quantity of life.
- **Perspective**: Defines whose costs/benefits are included (societal, health system, payer, patient).
- **HTA**: Health Technology Assessment, evaluating interventions for adoption.
- **UHC**: Universal Health Coverage, ensuring equitable access to care.
- **Partial/Full Evaluation**: Single vs. comparative intervention analysis.

### 🌟 Conclusion

**Economic evaluation is not just about money—it’s about making wise decisions in the face of scarcity.** This lecture provides a robust framework for understanding and applying economic evaluation to **prioritize funding**, **improve equity**, and **maximize health gains**. By mastering its types, principles, perspectives, and timing, public health professionals can guide health systems toward **sustainable**, **transparent**, and **equitable** outcomes, aligning with Malaysia’s goals for **UHC** and effective **HTA**.

## 🏥 1. Introduction: The Challenge of Health Resource Allocation

The allocation of resources in healthcare is a complex and critical task, as health systems worldwide grapple with the tension between **infinite health needs** and **finite resources**. This section introduces the core challenge of health economics: making informed decisions about how to deploy limited resources to maximize health outcomes. By exploring the constraints of funding, the limitations of traditional decision-making, and the need for systematic approaches, we set the stage for understanding **economic evaluation** as a vital tool in health policy and practice.

### 💡 The Central Issue: Money and Medicine

> **"The only thing that a minister of health is ever destined to discuss with the medical profession is money."**  

This poignant statement captures the essence of health resource allocation: **money is at the heart of every healthcare decision**. Health ministers and policymakers are constantly navigating a landscape where financial constraints shape what can be achieved.

- **Ministries often face legitimate requests for additional funding**, each promising to improve health outcomes. For example, requests might include funding for new cancer treatments, expanded vaccination programs, or additional hospital beds. Each proposal is compelling, as it aims to enhance patient care or prevent disease.
- However, **resources**—including **money, people, time, facilities, and equipment**—are **limited** in all countries, regardless of their economic status. Even in wealthier nations, budgets are finite, and healthcare systems cannot fund every worthwhile initiative.
- As a result, **choices must be made** regarding the deployment of these scarce resources. Policymakers must decide which programs to prioritize, which to scale back, and which to reject outright. **There is never enough money to do everything worth doing**, making prioritization a universal challenge.

This reality underscores the need for a structured approach to decision-making, one that goes beyond subjective preferences and ensures resources are used efficiently and equitably.

### 🤔 Traditional Decision-Making: Gut Feelings

Historically, healthcare decisions have often relied on **gut feelings and educated guesses**, as noted in the lecture. While these approaches may be informed by experience, they lack the rigor needed for transparent and defensible resource allocation.

- **Gut feelings** involve intuitive judgments, often based on a policymaker’s or clinician’s sense of what seems right. For instance, a hospital administrator might prioritize a new surgical unit because it feels impactful, without quantifying its costs or benefits.
- **Educated guesses** incorporate some expertise or data but are still subjective. For example, a health official might estimate that a new screening program will save lives, but without systematic analysis, this remains speculative.
- Such approaches are insufficient because they **lack transparency** and **fail to compare alternatives systematically**. They cannot answer critical questions like: Is this intervention worth its cost? Could the same funds achieve more health gains elsewhere?

This reliance on intuition highlights the need for a more robust framework—one that provides evidence-based insights to guide resource allocation.

### ⚖️ The Need for Informed Choices

The lecture emphasizes that supporting one service or intervention often requires **cutting back on another**, creating a zero-sum scenario in resource-constrained environments. This trade-off demands a careful evaluation of costs, benefits, and priorities.

- **Stakeholders are reluctant to fund services without knowing their contents or specific costs**. For example, few would approve funding for a new medical device without understanding its purpose, effectiveness, or price. Similarly, patients and the public expect clarity on what they are paying for, whether through taxes or out-of-pocket expenses.
- **Giving support for one or several services/interventions means that something else should be cut back**. For instance, allocating funds to expand dialysis services might reduce the budget for preventive diabetes programs. These trade-offs are inevitable, and policymakers must weigh them carefully.
- **Policy makers need tools to make informed choices** about which requests to support. Without a systematic approach, decisions risk being arbitrary, inefficient, or inequitable. For example, how can a minister decide whether to fund a new cancer drug or a rural health clinic without clear evidence of their relative value?

**Economic evaluation** emerges as the solution to this challenge. By providing a comparative analysis of costs and consequences, it enables policymakers to make **evidence-informed decisions** that maximize health outcomes within budget constraints.

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

To equip you with the knowledge and skills to address these challenges, this session outlines clear learning outcomes. By the end of the lecture, you will be able to:

- **Define economic evaluation and its role in health decision-making**. You will understand how economic evaluation serves as a tool to assess the **value for money** of health interventions, ensuring resources are used efficiently.
- **Differentiate between types of economic evaluation**. You will learn to distinguish between methods like Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA), Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA), and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), each suited to different decision contexts.
- **Understand key economic concepts relevant to evaluation**. Concepts such as **opportunity cost**, **scarcity**, **efficiency**, and **marginal analysis** will provide the foundation for interpreting and conducting evaluations.
- **Recognize the importance of perspective in cost analysis**. You will explore how the choice of perspective (e.g., societal, health system, patient) shapes the costs and outcomes considered, influencing the conclusions of an evaluation.

These outcomes lay the groundwork for mastering economic evaluation, empowering you to contribute to **transparent, equitable, and efficient health systems** as public health professionals, researchers, or policymakers.

## 📊 2. What is Economic Evaluation?

Economic evaluation is a foundational concept in health economics, providing a structured framework to compare health interventions and guide resource allocation decisions. This section defines economic evaluation, outlines its key characteristics, and explains how it assesses both **costs** and **consequences** to determine **value for money**. By understanding its purpose and applications, you will appreciate how economic evaluation drives **efficient**, **transparent**, and **evidence-based** decision-making in healthcare.

### 🔍 Definition

> **Economic evaluation** is **"a comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences."**  
> — Drummond et al., 2005

This definition highlights the essence of economic evaluation: it is a **systematic comparison** that weighs both the **resources consumed** and the **health outcomes achieved** by different interventions. Unlike simple budgeting, which focuses solely on costs, economic evaluation emphasizes **value for money**, ensuring that health systems maximize benefits within constrained budgets.

- **Central tool in health economics**: Economic evaluation is a cornerstone methodology, widely used to inform policy and practice in healthcare.
- **Goes beyond simple cost accounting**: It moves past merely tallying expenses to assess whether the costs of an intervention are justified by its outcomes, focusing on **value for money**.
- **Applied to drugs, devices, programs, services, and policies**: Its versatility allows it to evaluate a wide range of health interventions, from new pharmaceuticals to public health campaigns and hospital services.

By providing a rigorous framework, economic evaluation helps policymakers answer critical questions about which interventions offer the greatest health benefits for the resources invested.

### ✨ Key Characteristics

Economic evaluation is distinguished by three core characteristics that ensure its robustness and applicability in health decision-making:

- **Comparative**: Economic evaluation **always compares at least two alternatives** to determine which offers better value. This comparative approach is essential for informed decision-making.
    
    - **Examples**:
        - Comparing a **new drug** to **standard care** to assess whether the new treatment is worth its cost.
        - Evaluating **hospital-based care** versus **home-based care** to determine the most cost-effective delivery model.
        - Analyzing a **preventive intervention** (e.g., a vaccination program) against **no intervention** to quantify its benefits.
    - This ensures that decisions are not made in isolation but are based on **relative performance** of options.
- **Dual-focused**: It examines both **costs** and **outcomes**, recognizing that neither alone is sufficient for decision-making.
    
    - Knowing **how much an intervention costs** is meaningless without understanding **what it achieves**.
    - Similarly, knowing **whether an intervention works** is incomplete without considering **its cost**.
    - By integrating both dimensions, economic evaluation provides a **holistic view** of an intervention’s value.
- **Systematic & Structured**: Economic evaluation uses **defined methods and models** to ensure consistency and reliability.
    
    - It follows **transparent** processes, allowing others to understand and verify the analysis.
    - It is **reproducible**, meaning that different analysts applying the same methods should reach similar conclusions.
    - This structured approach enhances **credibility** and supports **evidence-based policy**.

These characteristics make economic evaluation a powerful tool for navigating the complexities of healthcare resource allocation.

### 💰 Understanding Costs

**Costs** in economic evaluation refer to the **value of resources used** to implement an intervention. These resources are not limited to financial expenditures but encompass a broad range of inputs, each of which must be carefully considered.

- **Direct medical costs**: These are expenses directly related to healthcare delivery, such as:
    
    - **Hospital stays**: Costs of inpatient care, including bed occupancy and medical procedures.
    - **Medications**: Costs of drugs prescribed to patients.
    - **Staff time**: Salaries and wages for doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals involved in the intervention.
- **Direct non-medical costs**: These are non-healthcare-related expenses incurred as a result of the intervention, such as:
    
    - **Transport**: Costs for patients or families to travel to healthcare facilities.
    - **Caregiving**: Expenses for professional or informal caregivers supporting patients.
- **Indirect costs**: These reflect the broader economic impact of the intervention, such as:
    
    - **Productivity losses**: Lost income or work output due to illness, treatment, or recovery time. For example, a patient undergoing surgery may be unable to work, resulting in lost wages.
- **Intangible costs**: These are non-financial costs that are difficult to quantify, such as:
    
    - **Pain** or **anxiety** experienced by patients or their families.
    - These are **rarely monetized** due to measurement challenges but may still be considered in certain analyses.
- **Key requirement**: Costs must be **identified, measured, and valued** based on the **perspective** of the evaluation.
    
    - The **perspective** (e.g., societal, health system, patient) determines which costs are included. For instance, a societal perspective includes all costs, while a health system perspective focuses only on medical costs.
    - This ensures that the evaluation aligns with the decision-maker’s goals and context.

Understanding the full scope of costs is critical for accurately assessing an intervention’s resource requirements and ensuring fair comparisons.

### 📈 Understanding Consequences

**Consequences** refer to the **outcomes or effects** of an intervention, capturing the health benefits or changes it produces. These outcomes are the counterpart to costs, providing the "benefit" side of the value-for-money equation.

- **Clinical outcomes**: These are direct health effects, such as:
    
    - **Infections prevented**: For example, a vaccination program reducing the incidence of measles.
    - **Life years gained**: Extending patient survival through treatments like heart surgery.
- **Preference-weighted outcomes**: These account for both the quantity and quality of life, using metrics like:
    
    - **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**: A measure that combines life expectancy with quality of life, where 1 QALY represents one year in perfect health.
    - **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)**: A measure of disease burden, reflecting years lost due to disability or premature death.
- **Economic outcomes**: These are outcomes converted into monetary values, typically used in cost-benefit analysis.
    
    - For example, the monetary value of **productivity gains** from a workplace health program.
- **Requirements for outcomes**:
    
    - Outcomes must be **meaningful** to **patients** (e.g., improving quality of life) and **providers** (e.g., reducing hospital readmissions).
    - They must be **measurable** over a **relevant time horizon**, ensuring that short-term and long-term effects are captured accurately.

By quantifying consequences, economic evaluation ensures that the health benefits of interventions are clearly understood and comparable across alternatives.

### 🎯 Purpose of Economic Evaluation

The primary purpose of economic evaluation is to answer a critical question:

> **"Is the added benefit of this option worth the additional cost?"**

This question encapsulates the core goal of economic evaluation: to guide decision-makers in allocating scarce resources efficiently. By comparing the costs and consequences of different interventions, economic evaluation provides actionable insights for health policy and practice.

- **Supports efficient allocation of limited health resources**: In a world of finite budgets, economic evaluation helps prioritize interventions that deliver the greatest health benefits per unit of cost.
- **Helps decide whether to adopt, scale up, delay, or reject interventions**: Policymakers use economic evaluation to determine which interventions are worth implementing, expanding, postponing, or discontinuing.
- **Prioritizes interventions with high value for money**: By focusing on interventions that offer significant health gains relative to their costs, economic evaluation maximizes the impact of healthcare spending.

Economic evaluation thus serves as a bridge between clinical evidence and policy decisions, ensuring that resources are used to achieve the greatest possible health outcomes.

#### Example: Cost vs. Effectiveness

To illustrate how economic evaluation works in practice, consider the following comparison of two treatment options:

| Option            | Cost (RM) | Effectiveness (Life Years Gained) | Cost per Life Year          |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| A (Standard Care) | 10,000    | 3                                 | $\frac{10000}{3} = 3333.33$ |
| B (New Treatment) | 14,000    | 4                                 | $\frac{14000}{4} = 3500$    |

This table compares **Standard Care (Option A)** and a **New Treatment (Option B)** based on their costs and effectiveness, measured in **life years gained**. The **cost per life year** is calculated as:

**Decision-makers must consider**:

- **Is the extra RM4,000 for Option B justified by the additional year of life?**
    
    - Option B costs RM14,000 and yields 4 life years, compared to Option A’s RM10,000 and 3 life years. The additional cost of RM4,000 (14,000 - 10,000) delivers one extra life year (4 - 3).
    - The question is whether this incremental benefit (1 life year) is worth the incremental cost (RM4,000).
- **Would that RM4,000 yield more value if spent elsewhere?**
    
    - Policymakers must assess whether investing RM4,000 in another intervention (e.g., a preventive program or a different treatment) could produce greater health benefits than the additional life year gained from Option B.

This example demonstrates how economic evaluation quantifies trade-offs, enabling decision-makers to weigh costs against benefits and consider alternative uses of resources. The **cost per life year** metric provides a standardized way to compare interventions, supporting **informed** and **transparent** decisions.

## 🌍 3. Relevance to Health Systems

Economic evaluation is a vital tool for navigating the complexities of modern healthcare systems, where **limited resources** must meet **growing demands**. This section explores why economic evaluation is essential for health systems, particularly in Malaysia, by addressing the challenges of **scarcity**, ensuring **efficiency**, and aligning with broader health system goals. By providing **transparent** and **evidence-based** insights, economic evaluation supports **fair**, **accountable**, and **sustainable** decision-making across various levels of healthcare policy and practice.

### 🚨 Why Economic Evaluation Matters

Health systems operate under intense pressure to deliver high-quality care within constrained budgets. Economic evaluation is crucial because it provides a structured approach to making informed decisions in this resource-scarce environment.

- **Limited healthcare budgets cannot meet the rising demand for services**. As populations grow, age, and face new health challenges, the demand for healthcare services—such as advanced treatments, preventive programs, and infrastructure—continues to escalate, outpacing available funds.
- **Economic evaluation ensures**:
    - **Transparency in decision-making**: By clearly outlining the costs and benefits of interventions, it allows stakeholders to understand the rationale behind resource allocation choices.
    - **Accountability in spending**: It holds decision-makers accountable for using public funds responsibly, ensuring that every ringgit spent delivers measurable value.
    - **Fair and efficient use of public funds**: It promotes equitable distribution of resources and prioritizes interventions that maximize health outcomes for the population.
- **It is especially relevant for**:
    - **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)**: Evaluating new technologies, drugs, or procedures to determine their cost-effectiveness before adoption.
    - **National Formulary listing**: Deciding which medications to include in publicly funded drug lists, such as Malaysia’s MyHEALTH or MyHD lists.
    - **Universal Health Coverage (UHC) initiatives**: Supporting equitable access to essential health services, a key goal of UHC, by identifying interventions that offer the greatest value within budget constraints.

By addressing these critical areas, economic evaluation ensures that health systems operate with **clarity**, **responsibility**, and a focus on **maximizing health outcomes**.

### 🧠 Addressing the Fundamental Challenge

Health systems worldwide, including Malaysia’s, face a universal question:

> **How to deliver the best possible health outcomes with limited resources?**

This challenge is at the core of health economics, as resources—whether financial, human, or infrastructural—are always finite, while health needs are virtually limitless. Economic evaluation provides a practical framework to tackle this issue by offering evidence-based guidance for resource allocation.

- **Economic evaluation helps**:
    - **Prioritize funding**: It identifies which interventions deliver the greatest health benefits, enabling policymakers to allocate budgets to high-impact programs.
    - **Improve health equity**: By assessing the distributional impact of interventions, it ensures that resources reach underserved populations, reducing disparities in access to care.
    - **Maximize health gains**: It focuses on interventions that provide significant health benefits relative to their costs, optimizing the overall health of the population.
    - **Ensure transparency and accountability**: By using systematic and reproducible methods, economic evaluation builds trust in the decision-making process, showing stakeholders how and why choices are made.

In Malaysia, where the healthcare system balances public and private provision, economic evaluation is particularly valuable for aligning resources with national health priorities, such as improving access to care and addressing non-communicable diseases.

### ⚠️ The Problem of Scarcity

**Scarcity** is a universal constraint that shapes every healthcare decision:

- **Infinite health needs** vs. **finite resources** (budget, staff, infrastructure, time). The demand for healthcare—new treatments, preventive services, and facilities—far exceeds the available supply of resources, creating a constant need for prioritization.
- **Examples of tough choices**:
    - Should the health system **expand dialysis services** to support more patients with kidney failure, or **fund cancer screening** to detect and treat cancers early?
    - Is it better to **subsidize a new vaccine** to prevent infectious diseases, or **increase ICU beds** to manage critical care needs during emergencies?
- **Economic evaluation enables rational and transparent decision-making**. By quantifying the costs and benefits of each option, it provides a clear basis for choosing between competing priorities, ensuring that decisions are **evidence-based** and **justifiable** to stakeholders.

Scarcity forces health systems to make difficult trade-offs, but economic evaluation transforms these choices from subjective judgments into **systematic** and **defensible** decisions.

### 🗳️ Informing Policy and Decision-Making

Economic evaluation supports decisions at multiple levels of the health system, from national policies to facility-level choices, by providing **evidence** to justify decisions based on **value for money**.

|Level|Example Decision|
|---|---|
|**National**|Include a cancer drug in MyHEALTH or MyHD list?|
|**State**|Roll out mobile dental clinics or invest in fluoride varnish?|
|**Facility**|Choose between two new ventilator models?|

- **National level**: Economic evaluation informs decisions about including new drugs or technologies in national formularies, such as Malaysia’s MyHEALTH or MyHD lists, ensuring that only cost-effective options are adopted.
- **State level**: It guides regional health authorities in choosing between community-based interventions, like mobile dental clinics for rural areas, or preventive measures, like fluoride varnish to reduce dental caries.
- **Facility level**: Hospitals use economic evaluation to select equipment, such as choosing between ventilator models based on their cost-effectiveness and impact on patient outcomes.

By providing **quantitative evidence**, economic evaluation ensures that decisions at all levels are **aligned with the goal of maximizing health benefits** within available resources.

### 💸 Ensuring Value for Money (Efficiency)

Not all interventions offer equal value, and economic evaluation helps identify those that deliver the greatest health benefits for their cost.

|Intervention|Cost|Outcome|Cost-Effectiveness|
|---|---|---|---|
|Drug A|RM100,000|Extends life by 2 weeks|Low|
|Vaccine B|RM200|Prevents fatal illness|High|

- **Drug A**: At a cost of RM100,000, it extends life by only 2 weeks, resulting in **low cost-effectiveness**. The high cost for a minimal benefit suggests that this intervention may not be the best use of resources.
- **Vaccine B**: For just RM200, it prevents a fatal illness, offering **high cost-effectiveness**. This intervention delivers significant health benefits at a low cost, making it a priority for funding.
- **Economic evaluation helps avoid inefficient spending** by identifying interventions like Drug A that consume substantial resources for limited gains.
- It **redirects funds to high-impact interventions** like Vaccine B, which maximize health outcomes per ringgit spent.

This focus on **efficiency** ensures that health systems achieve the greatest possible impact with their limited budgets.

### 📰 Enhancing Transparency and Accountability

Transparent use of economic evaluation is essential for building trust and justifying health spending decisions:

- **Builds public trust in health spending**: By clearly explaining why certain interventions are funded, economic evaluation reassures the public that resources are used wisely.
- **Justifies why some treatments are funded and others are not**: For example, if a costly drug is excluded from the national formulary, economic evaluation provides evidence that its benefits do not justify its cost, making the decision defensible.
- **Supports evidence-informed policy**: It ensures that policies are grounded in data, reducing the risk of arbitrary or politically driven decisions.
- **Critical for public programs** like:
    - **Peka B40**: A Malaysian program providing healthcare for low-income groups, where economic evaluation ensures that funds are used effectively to benefit vulnerable populations.
    - **Vaccination Programme**: Economic evaluation supports decisions about which vaccines to include in national immunization efforts, maximizing public health impact.
    - **HTA reviews by MaHTAS**: Malaysia’s Health Technology Assessment body relies on economic evaluation to assess new technologies, ensuring that only cost-effective options are adopted.

By fostering **transparency** and **accountability**, economic evaluation strengthens public confidence in the healthcare system and supports **evidence-based governance**.

### 🌟 Alignment with Health System Goals

Economic evaluation contributes to the overarching goals of health systems, ensuring that resources are used to achieve **equity**, **efficiency**, and **sustainability**:

- **Equity**: Ensures **fair allocation of resources across population groups**. Economic evaluation helps identify interventions that benefit underserved or marginalized communities, reducing health disparities.
- **Efficiency**: Delivers **more health per ringgit spent**. By prioritizing cost-effective interventions, it maximizes the health benefits achieved within budget constraints.
- **Sustainability**: Helps maintain **long-term affordability of the health system**. By avoiding wasteful spending and focusing on high-value interventions, economic evaluation ensures that healthcare remains viable for future generations.

These contributions align with Malaysia’s health system priorities, such as achieving Universal Health Coverage and improving health outcomes for all citizens.

## 📋 4. Types of Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluation encompasses a variety of methods, each tailored to specific decision-making contexts in healthcare. This section explores the **four main types** of economic evaluation—Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA), Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA), and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)—detailing their **outcome measures**, **decision focuses**, and **applications**. Additionally, it distinguishes between **partial** and **full** economic evaluations, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to select the appropriate method based on the context and evidence available. By mastering these types, you will be equipped to choose the right evaluation approach to guide **efficient** and **evidence-based** health policy decisions.

### 🔄 Overview

There are **four main types** of economic evaluation, each differing in **how outcomes are measured** and **what decision they address**. These methods provide structured frameworks to compare health interventions, ensuring that resources are allocated to maximize health benefits.

|Type|Outcome Measure|Decision Focus|
|---|---|---|
|**CMA**|Same outcome|Which is cheaper?|
|**CEA**|Natural units (e.g., life years)|Which gives more health for the cost?|
|**CUA**|Utility-based (e.g., QALYs)|Which gives more value considering quality of life?|
|**CBA**|Money (RM)|Do the monetary benefits exceed the costs?|

This table summarizes the essence of each type, highlighting their unique approaches to measuring outcomes and guiding decisions. Each method is suited to specific scenarios, depending on the nature of the intervention and the decision-maker’s priorities.

### 1️⃣ Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)

**Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)** is used when the outcomes of two or more interventions are **proven to be identical**, making cost the sole differentiating factor.

- **Use When**:
    - Two or more interventions have **proven identical outcomes**, meaning their effectiveness is equivalent based on robust evidence.
    - The decision is **solely about cost differences**, focusing on identifying the cheapest option without compromising effectiveness.
- **Examples**:
    - Choosing between **two bioequivalent generic drugs** with different prices. For instance, if two generic versions of a medication have identical therapeutic effects, CMA compares their costs to select the more affordable one.
    - Selecting between **two labs** offering the same test accuracy. If two diagnostic labs provide identical results for a blood test, CMA determines which lab charges less.
- **Important**:
    - CMA is **rarely used** because it requires **strong evidence** that outcomes are truly equal. In practice, interventions often differ slightly in effectiveness, making other evaluation types more appropriate.

CMA is a straightforward method but limited in scope, as identical outcomes are uncommon in healthcare, necessitating careful validation before its application.

### 2️⃣ Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)

**Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)** evaluates interventions based on **natural units** of health outcomes, making it ideal for comparing interventions where quality of life is not the primary concern.

- **Outcome Measure**:
    - **Natural units**, such as:
        - **Life years gained**: Extending patient survival through treatments like heart failure drugs.
        - **Cases detected**: Identifying diseases through screening programs, such as breast cancer detection.
        - **Hospital admissions avoided**: Reducing hospitalizations through preventive measures, like vaccinations.
- **Examples**:
    - Comparing two cancer screening methods based on **cost per case detected**. For instance, evaluating mammography versus ultrasound for breast cancer screening to determine which detects more cases per unit of cost.
    - Assessing **cost per life year gained** from a new heart failure drug, comparing its cost and survival benefits to standard treatment.
- **Output**:
    - **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, which measures the additional cost per unit of additional effectiveness:  
        $$ICER = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta E}$$  
        where (\Delta C) is the difference in costs, and (\Delta E) is the difference in effectiveness.
        - Example: An ICER of RM50,000 per life year gained indicates that each additional year of life costs RM50,000 compared to the alternative.
- **Used When**:
    - The outcome is important but does not need to capture **quality of life**. CEA is suitable for clinical outcomes like survival or disease detection, where well-being is not the primary focus.

CEA is widely used in healthcare for its simplicity and focus on measurable health outcomes, but it does not account for the qualitative aspects of health, such as patient comfort or disability.

### 3️⃣ Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)

**Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)** incorporates both the **quantity** and **quality** of life, using utility-based measures to assess interventions where well-being is a critical factor.

- **Outcome Measure**:
    - **Utility-based measures**, such as:
        - **QALYs** (Quality-Adjusted Life Years): A metric combining life expectancy with quality of life, where 1 QALY represents one year in perfect health.
        - **DALYs** (Disability-Adjusted Life Years): A measure of disease burden, reflecting years lost due to disability or premature death.
    - Captures both **quantity** (length of life) and **quality** (well-being), providing a comprehensive view of health outcomes.
- **Examples**:
    - Evaluating a cancer treatment that prolongs life but has **toxic side effects**. CUA assesses whether the extended survival justifies the reduced quality of life due to side effects.
    - Comparing **surgery vs. physiotherapy** in elderly patients, weighing the benefits of improved mobility against surgical risks and recovery time.
- **Output**:
    - **Cost per QALY gained** (e.g., RM100,000/QALY), indicating the cost of achieving one additional year of perfect health.
- **Key Note**:
    - **CUA is the most commonly recommended method for Health Technology Assessment (HTA)** because it accounts for both survival and quality of life, making it versatile for evaluating complex interventions.

CUA’s ability to integrate quality of life makes it a preferred choice for HTA bodies like Malaysia’s MaHTAS, but it requires robust data on patient preferences and health states.

### 4️⃣ Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)

**Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)** converts all outcomes into **monetary values**, allowing comparisons across health and non-health sectors.

- **Outcome Measure**:
    - All outcomes are **converted into monetary value** (RM), such as the financial value of health improvements or productivity gains.
- **Key Question**:
    
    > **"Do the benefits (in RM) outweigh the costs?"**
    
    - CBA seeks to determine whether the monetary benefits of an intervention exceed its costs, providing a clear financial perspective.
- **Examples**:
    - Evaluating a workplace health program based on **saved productivity**. For instance, a program reducing employee sick days may generate monetary benefits through increased work output.
    - Assessing safety interventions in monetary terms, such as the **RM value of life saved** in road safety campaigns.
- **Advantages**:
    - Allows comparison across **non-health sectors**, such as education or transportation, by expressing all outcomes in a common monetary unit.
- **Challenges**:
    - **Monetizing life, pain, or suffering is ethically and methodologically controversial**. Assigning a monetary value to human life or emotional distress can be contentious and difficult to quantify accurately.

CBA’s strength lies in its broad applicability, but its reliance on monetization limits its use in health contexts where ethical considerations are paramount.

### 📊 Summary Table: Types of Economic Evaluation

The following table consolidates the key features and limitations of each evaluation type, providing a quick reference for decision-makers:

|Type|Outcome|Example|Key Limitation|
|---|---|---|---|
|**CMA**|Same outcomes|Two bioequivalent drugs|Rare in practice|
|**CEA**|Natural units|Cost per case prevented|Doesn’t value quality of life|
|**CUA**|QALYs/DALYs|Cancer treatment analysis|Utility data needed|
|**CBA**|RM|Workplace wellness ROI|Hard to monetize outcomes|

This table highlights the trade-offs between methods, emphasizing the need to match the evaluation type to the decision context and available data.

### 🧩 Choosing the Right Evaluation Type

Selecting the appropriate type of economic evaluation is critical for ensuring that the analysis addresses the decision-maker’s needs:

- The **context** and **decision needs** determine the best approach. For example, a hospital choosing between identical diagnostic tests may use CMA, while a national HTA body evaluating a new drug may prefer CUA.
- **Key question**: **Is there evidence on the effectiveness of interventions?**
    - If **no**, economic evaluation may not be feasible, as reliable data on outcomes are essential for meaningful analysis.
    - If **yes**, select the type based on the **outcome measure** (e.g., natural units for CEA, QALYs for CUA) and **decision focus** (e.g., cost savings for CMA, monetary benefits for CBA).

This decision-making process ensures that the evaluation is **relevant**, **feasible**, and **aligned** with the goals of the analysis.

### 🔍 Partial vs. Full Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluations can be classified as **partial** or **full**, depending on whether they include a comparator scenario:

- **Partial Evaluation**:
    - A **cost-outcome study** that evaluates **a single course of action** without a comparator.
    - **Example**: Assessing the costs and outcomes of a single policy option, such as a new public health campaign, without comparing it to an alternative.
    - Partial evaluations are limited because they do not provide a relative assessment of value, making them less robust for decision-making.
- **Full Economic Evaluation**:
    - **Explicitly compares** the costs and consequences of **two or more alternatives**, providing a more comprehensive analysis.
    - **Example**: Comparing a new treatment to standard care to determine which offers better value for money.
    - Full evaluations are preferred in health economics because they enable decision-makers to weigh trade-offs between options.

The difference between full economic evaluations and cost-outcome partial evaluations lies in the presence of a comparator scenario. Full evaluations include at least one alternative, allowing for a direct comparison of costs and consequences, while partial evaluations focus on a single intervention in isolation.

This distinction underscores the importance of comparators in ensuring that economic evaluations provide actionable insights for resource allocation.

## 💡 5. Key Economic Concepts

Economic evaluations in healthcare are grounded in fundamental economic principles that shape how resources are allocated and decisions are made. This section explores four critical concepts—**Opportunity Cost**, **Scarcity**, **Efficiency**, and **Marginal Analysis**—which are essential for conducting and interpreting economic evaluations. By understanding these principles, you will be equipped to make **value-based** decisions that maximize health outcomes within the constraints of limited resources, ensuring that healthcare systems operate **efficiently** and **equitably**.

### 🌟 Why Economic Concepts Matter

Before conducting or interpreting any economic evaluation, it’s **crucial** to understand the economic principles underpinning health decisions. These principles provide the theoretical foundation for evaluating interventions and prioritizing resources in a way that aligns with the goals of health systems.

- **Opportunity Cost**: Highlights the trade-offs inherent in every decision, ensuring that the value of foregone alternatives is considered.
- **Scarcity**: Explains why prioritization is necessary, given the mismatch between limited resources and unlimited health needs.
- **Efficiency**: Guides the allocation of resources to achieve the maximum possible health benefits.
- **Marginal Analysis**: Enables fine-tuned decisions by examining the incremental costs and benefits of small changes in resource allocation.

**These concepts ensure decisions are value-based, not just cost-based**, moving beyond simple budgeting to focus on the **health outcomes** achieved per unit of cost. By anchoring economic evaluations in these principles, decision-makers can make **informed**, **transparent**, and **defensible** choices that optimize resource use.

### 1️⃣ Opportunity Cost

**Definition**:

- **The value of the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made**. Opportunity cost represents what is sacrificed when one option is chosen over another, emphasizing the trade-offs inherent in resource allocation.

**In Healthcare**:

- **Funding a cancer screening program may mean not funding additional ICU beds**. For example, allocating resources to screen for breast cancer might reduce the budget available to expand critical care capacity, impacting patients needing intensive care.
- **Spending RM1 million on Drug A means forgoing what could have been achieved with that RM1 million elsewhere**. If RM1 million is spent on an expensive medication, the opportunity cost could be the inability to fund a vaccination program that might prevent thousands of infections.

**Takeaway**:

- **Every decision involves a trade-off**. Recognizing opportunity costs ensures that decision-makers weigh the benefits of the chosen intervention against the potential benefits of alternatives, promoting **efficient** and **strategic** resource use.

Opportunity cost is a cornerstone of economic thinking, reminding us that resources are finite and every choice has consequences for what is left undone.

### 2️⃣ Scarcity

**Definition**:

- **Resources (money, staff, time, technology) are limited, but health needs are unlimited**. Scarcity is the fundamental economic problem, where the demand for healthcare far exceeds the supply of resources available to meet it.

**In Real Terms**:

- **There are not enough doctors, nurses, or funds to do everything**. For instance, a hospital may lack the staff to provide specialized care to all patients, or a health ministry may lack the budget to fund every proposed intervention.
- **Not every patient can receive every possible treatment**. Due to resource constraints, some patients may face delays in care, or certain treatments may not be available in public facilities.

**Implication**:

- **Scarcity forces choices**, and **economic evaluation helps guide them**. By providing a systematic way to compare the costs and benefits of different interventions, economic evaluation ensures that limited resources are allocated to the most impactful options, addressing the most pressing health needs.

Scarcity underscores the need for prioritization in healthcare, making economic evaluation an indispensable tool for navigating these constraints.

### 3️⃣ Efficiency in Healthcare

**Definition**:

- **Achieving the maximum benefit from available resources**. Efficiency is about getting the most health outcomes—such as lives saved, diseases prevented, or quality of life improved—for the resources invested.

**Two Main Types**:

1. **Technical Efficiency**:
    - **Producing a given output at the lowest cost**. This involves delivering a specific health service or outcome as economically as possible without compromising quality.
    - **Example**: Using **generic drugs** instead of branded ones. Generic drugs provide the same therapeutic benefits at a lower cost, freeing up resources for other priorities.
2. **Allocative Efficiency**:
    - **Allocating resources to maximize overall population health**. This involves choosing interventions that benefit the largest number of people or address the most significant health challenges.
    - **Example**: Investing in **vaccinations** vs. rare-disease treatments. Vaccinations may prevent widespread illness across a population, while rare-disease treatments benefit a smaller group, making the former more allocatively efficient in many contexts.

**Outcome**:

- **Efficient choices lead to more health gains per RM spent**. By optimizing resource use, efficiency ensures that health systems deliver greater value, improving access to care and health outcomes within budget constraints.

Efficiency is a guiding principle in health economics, ensuring that every ringgit spent contributes to the greatest possible health impact.

### 4️⃣ Marginal Analysis

**Definition**:

- **Examines the additional (marginal) cost and benefit of increasing or decreasing an activity by a small amount**. Marginal analysis focuses on the incremental effects of small changes, helping decision-makers fine-tune resource allocation.

**In Practice**:

- **What is the extra cost of screening 1,000 more people?** For example, extending a cancer screening program to an additional 1,000 individuals may require additional staff, equipment, and facilities, increasing costs.
- **Does the additional benefit justify the added cost?** If screening 1,000 more people detects only a few additional cases, the benefit may not outweigh the cost, suggesting that resources might be better used elsewhere.

**Key Tool**:

- **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**:  
    $$ ICER = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta E} $$
    - Measures **how much extra is paid for each additional unit of outcome**, where $\Delta C$ is the difference in costs, and $\Delta E$ is the difference in effectiveness.
    - For example, if a new treatment costs an additional RM50,000 and provides one extra year of life compared to standard care, the ICER is RM50,000 per life year gained.

Marginal analysis allows decision-makers to assess whether small increases in investment are worthwhile, ensuring that resources are allocated where they generate the most value.

### 📊 Recap: Why These Concepts Matter

The following table summarizes the practical importance of each economic concept, highlighting their role in shaping value-driven decisions:

|Concept|Practical Importance|
|---|---|
|**Opportunity Cost**|Recognizes trade-offs in decisions|
|**Scarcity**|Explains why prioritization is needed|
|**Efficiency**|Promotes maximum value from resources|
|**Marginal Analysis**|Helps fine-tune decision thresholds|

**These concepts underpin every economic evaluation model**, ensuring that decisions are **value-driven** rather than solely cost-driven. By integrating opportunity cost, scarcity, efficiency, and marginal analysis, economic evaluations provide a robust framework for prioritizing interventions that deliver the greatest health benefits within limited budgets.

## 👀 6. Perspective in Economic Evaluation

The **perspective** of an economic evaluation is a critical factor that shapes the scope and conclusions of the analysis. By defining **whose costs and benefits** are considered, the perspective determines which aspects of an intervention are evaluated and how the results are interpreted. This section explores the concept of perspective, details the **common perspectives** used in health economics, and illustrates how the choice of perspective can lead to different conclusions for the same intervention. Understanding perspective is essential for ensuring that economic evaluations are **aligned with the decision-making context** and produce **relevant** and **actionable** insights.

### 🔍 What is Perspective?

**Definition**:

- The **perspective** of an economic evaluation defines **whose costs and benefits** are included in the analysis. It establishes the lens through which the intervention’s impact is assessed, focusing on specific stakeholders or the broader society.

**It guides**:

- **What types of costs to include**: For example, whether to consider only medical costs or also non-medical costs like transportation.
- **Whose outcomes matter**: Whether the focus is on patient health, societal benefits, or payer savings.
- **How broad or narrow the evaluation is**: A societal perspective is comprehensive, while a health system perspective is more focused.

**Importance**:

- **Choosing the right perspective is critical**, as it **directly affects the conclusions** of the study. An inappropriate perspective can lead to misleading results, misguiding policy or resource allocation decisions.

The perspective serves as the foundation for structuring an economic evaluation, ensuring that the analysis is tailored to the needs of the decision-maker and the context of the decision.

### 🌐 Common Perspectives

Economic evaluations adopt different perspectives based on the stakeholders involved and the goals of the analysis. The following table summarizes the **four common perspectives**, their scope, and their typical users:

|Perspective|Includes|Often Used By|
|---|---|---|
|**Societal**|All costs and benefits (direct, indirect, intangible)|Academics, global health|
|**Health System / Provider**|Medical costs only (e.g., drugs, hospital stays)|Ministries of Health, public hospitals|
|**Payer**|Costs borne by insurer or funding agency|Insurance companies, governments|
|**Patient**|Out-of-pocket and indirect costs to the individual|Patient advocacy, equity studies|

Each perspective focuses on different costs and outcomes, making it essential to select the one that aligns with the evaluation’s purpose and audience.

#### 1️⃣ Societal Perspective

- **Most comprehensive perspective**, capturing the broadest range of costs and benefits across all stakeholders.
- **Includes**:
    - **Medical costs**: Expenses for treatments, hospitalizations, and medications.
    - **Non-medical costs**: Costs like transportation to healthcare facilities.
    - **Productivity losses**: Lost income due to illness or treatment-related absences.
    - **Informal caregiving**: Time and resources spent by family or friends providing care.
    - **Intangible costs**: Non-monetary costs like pain or suffering, though these are rarely monetized.
- **Pros**:
    - **Captures the total impact on society**, providing a holistic view of an intervention’s effects.
    - **Best for macro-level policy decisions**, such as national health strategies or global health initiatives.
- **Cons**:
    - **Data-intensive**, requiring extensive data collection across multiple sectors.
    - **Not always feasible in local or budget-specific contexts**, where data or resources may be limited.
- **Recommended by**: **WHO**, **OECD**, and for **cost-utility analyses** (e.g., those using QALYs), due to its comprehensive scope.

The societal perspective is ideal for broad policy questions but can be challenging to implement due to its complexity and data requirements.

#### 2️⃣ Health System / Provider Perspective

- **Focuses only on costs to the public health system or provider**, narrowing the scope to direct healthcare expenditures.
- **Includes**:
    - **Hospital stays**: Costs of inpatient care and facilities.
    - **Medications**: Costs of drugs provided by the health system.
    - **Staff time**: Salaries for healthcare professionals involved in the intervention.
    - **Equipment**: Costs of medical devices or infrastructure.
- **Excludes**:
    - **Patient out-of-pocket costs**: Expenses borne by individuals, such as co-payments.
    - **Lost productivity**: Economic impacts outside the health system, like missed work.
- **Suitable for**:
    - **Government budget planning**, where the focus is on managing public healthcare budgets.
    - **Evaluations submitted to HTA bodies** like **MaHTAS (Malaysia)**, which assess interventions for inclusion in public health systems.

This perspective is practical for health ministries and hospitals focused on optimizing their budgets but may overlook broader societal impacts.

#### 3️⃣ Payer Perspective

- **Focuses on costs to the third-party payer**, such as insurance companies, employer health plans, or government schemes.
- **Includes**:
    - **Reimbursed medical expenses**: Costs covered by the payer, such as hospital bills or drug reimbursements.
    - **Claims paid out**: Payments made to healthcare providers or patients under insurance plans.
- **Relevant in**:
    - Contexts where services are **insured or subsidized**, such as Malaysia’s **MySalam** program or private insurance plans.
- **Limitation**:
    - **May ignore downstream societal costs or patient burdens**, such as productivity losses or out-of-pocket expenses not covered by insurance.

The payer perspective is critical for entities managing insurance or reimbursement schemes but may not capture the full economic impact of an intervention.

#### 4️⃣ Patient Perspective

- **Focuses on the individual receiving care**, emphasizing the financial and personal burden on patients.
- **Includes**:
    - **Out-of-pocket medical expenses**: Costs paid directly by patients, such as co-pays or uncovered treatments.
    - **Travel, food, lodging costs**: Expenses incurred to access healthcare, such as transportation to clinics.
    - **Income loss due to illness or caregiving**: Lost wages from taking time off work for treatment or to care for a loved one.
- **Important for**:
    - **Equity analyses**: Assessing whether interventions disproportionately burden certain groups.
    - **Evaluating financial hardship and catastrophic health spending**: Identifying interventions that push patients into financial distress.
- **Used in**:
    - **Studies on cancer care affordability in Malaysia**, where high out-of-pocket costs can create significant barriers to access.

The patient perspective highlights the individual’s experience, making it essential for understanding equity and affordability issues.

### 🧠 Why Perspective Matters: Example

**Scenario**: Breast cancer treatment with a new targeted therapy.

The choice of perspective can lead to vastly different conclusions about the same intervention, as shown in the following table:

|Perspective|Evaluation Result|
|---|---|
|**Societal**|High cost, but offset by patient survival, return to work, reduced caregiver burden = **Cost-effective**|
|**Health System**|Expensive, limited budget impact benefit = **Not cost-effective**|
|**Patient**|High out-of-pocket cost despite subsidies = **Financially toxic**|

**Key Insight**:

- **The same intervention can yield different conclusions depending on the perspective**.
    - From a **societal perspective**, the treatment is cost-effective because it accounts for benefits like improved survival and productivity, which offset the high costs.
    - From a **health system perspective**, the treatment appears not cost-effective due to its high cost and limited budget impact within the healthcare system.
    - From a **patient perspective**, the treatment is financially toxic, as out-of-pocket costs create significant financial hardship despite subsidies.

This example illustrates how perspective shapes the evaluation’s focus and outcomes, highlighting the need to choose the perspective carefully based on the decision context.

### 📝 Summary: Perspective in Evaluation

**Perspective determines**:

- **What costs and outcomes are included**: For example, a societal perspective includes all costs, while a patient perspective focuses on individual expenses.
- **Who benefits or pays**: Whether the focus is on society, the health system, payers, or patients.
- **What decision is being supported**: The perspective aligns the evaluation with the specific policy or resource allocation question.

**Best Practice**:

- **Always align the perspective with**:
    - **The policy question**: What decision is the evaluation intended to inform?
    - **The target audience**: Who will use the results (e.g., policymakers, insurers, patients)?
    - **The data availability**: What data are feasible to collect for the analysis?

By aligning the perspective with these factors, economic evaluations produce **relevant**, **accurate**, and **decision-focused** results that guide effective resource allocation.

## ⏰ 7. Timing of Economic Evaluation

The timing of an economic evaluation is a critical factor in its effectiveness, as it determines whether the analysis can meaningfully inform resource allocation decisions. This section explores why **timing matters**, identifies **key situations** where economic evaluation is most valuable, and highlights scenarios where it may be less useful. By aligning evaluations with **decision-making needs** and ensuring the availability of **high-quality data**, economic evaluations can provide **timely**, **relevant**, and **actionable** insights to optimize healthcare resource use.

### 🕒 Why Timing Matters

Economic evaluation is not a one-size-fits-all exercise; it must be **purpose-driven** and **timely** to maximize its impact.

- **Economic evaluation should be purpose-driven and timely**. The value of an evaluation lies in its ability to provide actionable evidence when decisions are being made, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and effectively.
- **The right time to conduct an evaluation is when a decision needs to be made about allocating limited resources**. For example, an evaluation is most useful when policymakers are deciding whether to fund a new intervention or reallocate existing budgets.
- **Timing and context determine the evaluation’s usefulness**. An evaluation conducted too early (before sufficient data are available) or too late (after decisions are finalized) may fail to influence policy or practice. The context—such as budget cycles, policy windows, or emerging health challenges—shapes the relevance of the analysis.

By aligning economic evaluations with critical decision points, health systems can ensure that the results are both **relevant** and **impactful**, guiding resource allocation in a way that maximizes health outcomes.

### 📋 Situations That Call for Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluation is particularly valuable in specific scenarios where resource allocation decisions require evidence-based insights. The following situations highlight when economic evaluation is most needed:

1. **Introduction of New Health Interventions**
    
    - **Involves new drugs, vaccines, diagnostic tests, or surgical procedures**. These innovations often come with high costs and uncertain benefits, necessitating careful evaluation.
    - **Question**: **Is this intervention worth adopting given its cost and benefit?** Decision-makers need to determine whether the health benefits justify the investment.
    - **Example**: **Introducing a new breast cancer therapy under the national formulary**. An economic evaluation can assess whether the therapy’s benefits (e.g., improved survival) outweigh its costs compared to existing treatments.
2. **Scaling Up Existing Interventions**
    
    - **Expanding successful pilot programs to a national or state level**. Pilot programs may show promise in small-scale trials, but their cost-effectiveness at a larger scale must be confirmed.
    - **Question**: **Is the intervention still cost-effective at a larger scale?** Scaling up may involve higher costs or different outcomes, requiring re-evaluation.
    - **Example**: **Extending the HPV vaccination program to older age groups**. An evaluation can determine whether expanding the program to include additional populations remains cost-effective.
3. **Choosing Between Alternatives**
    
    - **Comparing two or more options that deliver similar services**. When multiple interventions achieve similar goals, economic evaluation identifies the most cost-effective option.
    - **Question**: **Which one offers more value for money?** The focus is on maximizing health benefits within budget constraints.
    - **Example**: **Comparing telehealth consultations vs. physical outpatient visits for chronic disease follow-up**. An evaluation can assess which delivery method provides better outcomes at a lower cost.
4. **Budget Allocation and Priority Setting**
    
    - **When multiple programs compete for the same funds**. Health systems often face competing demands, requiring prioritization to allocate limited resources effectively.
    - **Question**: **Which programs should be funded, expanded, or defunded?** Economic evaluation provides evidence to guide these tough choices.
    - **Example**: **Deciding between expanding dialysis services or preventive diabetes screening in rural areas**. An evaluation can compare the health impact and costs of each option to inform budget decisions.
5. **Addressing Concerns About Efficiency**
    
    - **When an existing intervention is suspected to be inefficient or outdated**. Programs that consume significant resources without delivering proportional benefits need re-assessment.
    - **Question**: **Are we spending too much for too little benefit?** Economic evaluation identifies opportunities to redirect resources to more effective interventions.
    - **Example**: **Re-evaluating national health screening guidelines that yield low detection rates**. An evaluation can determine whether the screening program justifies its costs or if resources should be reallocated.

These situations highlight the diverse applications of economic evaluation, from adopting new technologies to optimizing existing programs, ensuring that decisions are **evidence-based** and **aligned with health system goals**.

### 🚫 When Evaluation May Be Less Useful

While economic evaluation is a powerful tool, there are scenarios where it may not provide meaningful insights, and conducting an evaluation could be a poor use of resources.

- **Avoid conducting economic evaluation when**:
    - **Outcomes or effectiveness are unknown or highly uncertain**. Without reliable data on an intervention’s impact, economic evaluation cannot produce valid results. For example, a new drug with no clinical trial data cannot be meaningfully evaluated.
    - **Costs are trivial and unlikely to influence decisions**. If an intervention’s costs are negligible (e.g., a low-cost health education pamphlet), an evaluation may not be worth the effort.
    - **The intervention is not scalable or politically feasible**. If an intervention cannot be implemented widely due to logistical or political barriers, an evaluation may have little practical value.
- **Important**:
    - **Economic evaluation works best with high-quality effectiveness data**. Robust clinical or real-world evidence is essential for accurate cost-effectiveness estimates, ensuring that the evaluation is credible and useful.

Recognizing when economic evaluation is inappropriate helps decision-makers avoid wasting resources on analyses that cannot inform policy or practice.

### 📝 Summary: When to Conduct an Economic Evaluation

To maximize the impact of economic evaluation, it should be conducted in situations where it can directly inform resource allocation decisions:

- **Conduct an evaluation when**:
    - **A new resource allocation decision is needed**. For example, when deciding whether to fund a new treatment or program.
    - **There are competing interventions**. When multiple options vie for the same resources, evaluation identifies the most cost-effective choice.
    - **The goal is to maximize health benefit within budget constraints**. Evaluation ensures that limited funds are used to achieve the greatest possible health outcomes.
    - **Evidence will inform policy, procurement, or program expansion**. Evaluations are most valuable when their results can guide tangible actions, such as adopting a new drug or scaling up a public health program.
- **Tip**:
    - **Align the timing of evaluation with key decision points in planning or budgeting cycles**. For instance, conducting an evaluation during the annual budget planning process ensures that results are available when funding decisions are made.

By timing evaluations strategically, health systems can ensure that they are **relevant**, **timely**, and **impactful**, directly supporting **evidence-informed decision-making**.

By summarizing the **definition**, **importance**, **types**, **economic principles**, **perspectives**, and **timing** of economic evaluation, this section reinforces the critical role of these tools in **evidence-informed decision-making**. As public health professionals, researchers, or policymakers, understanding these takeaways equips you to navigate the challenges of resource allocation and drive **better health outcomes** in the face of scarcity.

### 🔍 What We Covered

This session introduced the **foundations of economic evaluation in health**, laying the groundwork for understanding how to assess and prioritize health interventions. The lecture covered:

- **What economic evaluation is**: A systematic approach to comparing interventions based on their costs and consequences.
- **Why it is important in health systems**: It ensures efficient, transparent, and equitable resource allocation.
- **The main types of evaluation**: Four distinct methods tailored to different decision-making needs.
- **Core economic concepts**: Principles that underpin value-based decision-making.
- **The importance of perspective**: How the choice of perspective shapes the evaluation’s scope and conclusions.
- **When economic evaluation is used**: Key scenarios where it provides actionable insights.

**Each component plays a critical role in evidence-informed decision-making**, enabling health systems to make **rational**, **transparent**, and **impactful** choices that maximize health benefits within limited budgets.

### 1️⃣ Key Takeaway: What is Economic Evaluation?

Economic evaluation is a cornerstone of health economics, providing a structured framework to assess the value of health interventions.

- **A comparative analysis of two or more interventions**: It always involves comparing at least two options, such as a new drug versus standard care, to determine which offers better value.
- **Examines both costs and consequences**: It considers both the resources consumed (e.g., financial costs, staff time) and the outcomes achieved (e.g., lives saved, quality of life improved).
- **Determines value for money in healthcare**: By quantifying costs and benefits, it helps identify interventions that deliver the greatest health impact per unit of cost.
- **Supports smart decisions in policy, budgeting, and clinical practice**: Economic evaluation informs decisions at national, state, and facility levels, ensuring resources are used efficiently and effectively.

This takeaway emphasizes that economic evaluation is not just about cost but about **balancing costs with health outcomes** to make informed choices.

### 2️⃣ Key Takeaway: Types of Economic Evaluation

The lecture outlined **four main types** of economic evaluation, each with a unique approach to measuring outcomes and addressing decision-making needs. The following table summarizes their key features:

|Type|Key Feature|Outcome Unit|
|---|---|---|
|**CMA**|Cost only|Same outcome|
|**CEA**|Cost per natural unit|Life years, cases detected|
|**CUA**|Cost per utility unit|QALYs, DALYs|
|**CBA**|Cost vs. benefit|Both in monetary value|

- **CMA (Cost-Minimization Analysis)**: Focuses on cost differences when outcomes are identical, e.g., choosing between two bioequivalent drugs.
- **CEA (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis)**: Measures outcomes in natural units (e.g., life years gained), suitable for clinical outcomes like disease detection.
- **CUA (Cost-Utility Analysis)**: Uses utility-based measures like QALYs or DALYs to capture both quantity and quality of life, ideal for Health Technology Assessments.
- **CBA (Cost-Benefit Analysis)**: Converts all outcomes to monetary values, allowing comparisons across sectors but raising ethical challenges in monetizing health.

This diversity ensures that economic evaluation can be tailored to specific contexts, from clinical decisions to cross-sector policy comparisons.

### 3️⃣ Key Takeaway: Economic Principles Matter

Understanding **core economic concepts** is essential for conducting and interpreting economic evaluations. These principles shape how resources are prioritized and allocated in healthcare.

- **Opportunity Cost**: **All choices involve trade-offs**. Choosing one intervention (e.g., funding a new drug) means forgoing another (e.g., expanding hospital beds), and decision-makers must weigh these trade-offs.
- **Scarcity**: **Not all needs can be met** due to limited resources (e.g., budget, staff, time), necessitating prioritization.
- **Efficiency**: The goal is to **get the most health for each Ringgit**, achieving maximum benefits through technical (lowest cost for output) and allocative (maximizing population health) efficiency.
- **Marginal Analysis**: Focuses on **incremental cost and benefit**, using metrics like the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) to assess whether additional investments are worthwhile.

**These concepts shape prioritization and resource allocation**, ensuring that decisions are **value-driven** rather than solely cost-driven, aligning with the goal of maximizing health outcomes.

### 4️⃣ Key Takeaway: Perspective Shapes Evaluation

The **perspective** of an economic evaluation—whether societal, health system, payer, or patient—determines the scope and focus of the analysis.

- **Which costs and benefits are included**: A societal perspective includes all costs (e.g., medical, non-medical, productivity losses), while a patient perspective focuses on out-of-pocket expenses.
- **How broadly the impact is measured**: A societal perspective captures the total societal impact, while a health system perspective is narrower, focusing only on medical costs.
- **Who the results are relevant to**: Different stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, insurers, patients) require different perspectives to address their specific needs.

**Best Practice**:

- **Align the perspective with the decision-maker’s goals**. For example, use a health system perspective for government budget planning or a patient perspective for equity studies to ensure relevance and applicability.

This takeaway underscores the importance of selecting the appropriate perspective to produce **relevant** and **actionable** evaluation results.

### 5️⃣ Key Takeaway: When to Use Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluation is most valuable in specific scenarios where it can inform resource allocation decisions, but it should be avoided in situations where it offers little value.

- **Conduct evaluation when**:
    - **Introducing new interventions**: Assessing whether new drugs, vaccines, or procedures are worth adopting (e.g., a new cancer therapy).
    - **Scaling or revising programs**: Evaluating whether expanding existing programs, like HPV vaccination, remains cost-effective.
    - **Facing budget or resource trade-offs**: Choosing between competing priorities, such as dialysis services versus diabetes screening.
    - **Making policy or reimbursement decisions**: Informing decisions about formulary listings or insurance coverage.
- **Avoid when**:
    - **Outcomes are uncertain**, as evaluations require reliable effectiveness data to be meaningful.
    - **The decision won’t change**, such as when costs are trivial or political factors override economic evidence.

This takeaway highlights the importance of **strategic timing** to ensure that evaluations are **relevant** and **impactful**.

### 🧠 Final Reflection

> **"Economic evaluation is not just about money—it’s about making wise decisions in the face of scarcity."**

This powerful statement encapsulates the essence of economic evaluation: it is a tool for navigating the constraints of limited resources to achieve the greatest possible health benefits. **As public health professionals, researchers, or policymakers**, your role is to use these tools to guide health systems toward **better outcomes for all**, ensuring **equity**, **efficiency**, and **sustainability** in healthcare delivery.

- **Apply** core concepts like **discounting**, **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, and **sensitivity analysis** to assess interventions.  
- **Understand** the role of **modeling** (e.g., decision trees, Markov models) in simulating long-term outcomes.

### 📊 Core Concepts and Methodologies

#### 🔄 Introduction to Economic Evaluation

**Economic evaluation (EE)** is defined as **"a comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences"** (Drummond et al., 2005). It supports **efficient resource allocation** by systematically comparing the **cost** and **value** of health interventions, such as new drugs or vaccination programs, to maximize health outcomes in Malaysia’s resource-constrained health system.

- **Types of Economic Evaluation**:  
  The lecture introduces four main types, each with distinct **outcome measures** and **decision foci**:  

| **Type** | **Outcome Measure** | **Decision Focus** |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **CMA (Cost-Minimization Analysis)** | Same outcomes | Which is cheaper? |
| **CEA (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis)** | Natural units (e.g., life-years gained) | More health for the cost? |
| **CUA (Cost-Utility Analysis)** | Utility-based (e.g., QALYs, DALYs) | Value considering quality of life? |
| **CBA (Cost-Benefit Analysis)** | Monetary (e.g., RM) | Do benefits exceed costs? |

#### ⚖️ Key Economic Principles

Economic evaluations are grounded in four principles:  
- **Scarcity**: Limited resources (e.g., money, staff) necessitate prioritization.  
- **Opportunity Cost**: The value of the next best alternative forgone (e.g., funding dialysis vs. cancer screening).  
- **Efficiency**: Maximizing health outcomes per resource unit, via **technical** (lowest cost for output) and **allocative** (maximizing population health) efficiency.  
- **Marginal Analysis**: Evaluating incremental costs and effects, using the **ICER**.

#### 👀 Importance of Perspective

**Perspective** defines **whose costs and benefits are counted**, shaping the evaluation’s scope. The lecture highlights four perspectives:

| **Perspective** | **Costs Included** | **Common Use** |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Societal** | All costs (direct, indirect, intangible) | Broad policy |
| **Health System** | Direct medical costs | HTA, Ministries |
| **Payer** | Reimbursed costs | Insurers, MySalam |
| **Patient** | Out-of-pocket, lost income | Equity studies |

**Key Insight**: The **same intervention** (e.g., a new cancer drug) can yield **different conclusions** based on perspective, such as **cost-effective** (societal) or **financially toxic** (patient).

#### 🛠️ Conducting a Full Economic Evaluation

A **full economic evaluation** follows a **10-step process**:  
1. **Define the Problem and Comparators**: Clearly state the issue and alternatives (e.g., new HPV vaccine vs. existing program).  
2. **Choose Perspective**: Determines costs and benefits included.  
3. **Set Time Horizon**: Duration for measuring outcomes (e.g., 5 years, lifetime).  
4. **Identify, Measure, Value Costs**: Categorize and quantify resources (e.g., drugs, travel).  
5. **Identify and Measure Outcomes**: Select meaningful metrics (e.g., QALYs).  
6. **Apply Discounting**: Adjust future values to present value at $3\%-5\%$.  
7. **Conduct Incremental Analysis**: Calculate **ICER** to compare interventions.  
8. **Perform Sensitivity Analysis**: Test uncertainty’s impact.  
9. **Use Modeling**: Simulate long-term outcomes.  
10. **Interpret and Present Results**: Align findings with policy priorities.

**Example**: Evaluating a **mobile dental clinic** vs. a **subsidy scheme** in rural Malaysia, using a 5-year horizon and health system perspective, with an ICER of RM per QALY.

#### 💰 Understanding Costs

**Cost** is the **value of resources consumed** (e.g., drugs, staff time). Costs are categorized as:  
- **Direct Medical**: Health system costs (e.g., chemotherapy drugs).  
- **Direct Non-Medical**: Access-related costs (e.g., patient travel).  
- **Indirect**: Productivity losses (e.g., sick leave).  
- **Intangible**: Non-financial costs (e.g., pain, anxiety).  

The **costing process** involves:  
1. **Identification**: List resources (e.g., chemo sessions).  
2. **Measurement**: Quantify use (e.g., 6 cycles).  
3. **Valuation**: Assign monetary values (e.g., RM1,500/cycle).  

**Micro-costing** (detailed) vs. **gross-costing** (average) approaches balance precision and effort.

#### 📊 Outcomes in Economic Evaluation

**Outcomes** are the **health consequences** of interventions, measured as:  
- **Natural Units** (CEA): Life-years gained, cases detected.  
- **Utility-Based** (CUA): **QALYs** (combining life length and quality, $0$ = death, $1$ = perfect health).  
- **Monetary** (CBA): RM value of benefits (e.g., productivity).  

**Utilities** are measured via **EQ-5D**, **Time Trade-Off**, or **Standard Gamble**, using published weights or patient data.

#### ⏰ Timing and Discounting

**Timing** matters due to **time preference** (valuing benefits now over later). **Discounting** adjusts future costs/outcomes to present value at **$3\%-5\%$**, critical for horizons exceeding 1 year. **Time horizon** varies:  
- Acute illness: ≤1 year.  
- Chronic disease: Lifetime (10–20 years).  
- Preventive: Until outcomes occur.  

**Example**: A breast cancer treatment yields $0.8$ QALYs undiscounted, $\approx 0.76$ QALYs at $3\%$.

#### 📈 Incremental Analysis and ICER

**Incremental analysis** compares **additional costs** and **benefits**, using the **ICER**:  
$$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{New}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{Comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{New}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{Comparator}}} $$

**Example**: Drug A (RM60,000, 2.0 QALYs) vs. Drug B (RM20,000, 1.5 QALYs) yields an ICER of **80,000 RM/QALY**.  
- **Thresholds**:  
  - **WTP**: RM90,000–120,000/QALY (Malaysia).  
  - **GDP-based**: RM50,000–150,000/QALY.  
  - **Opportunity cost**: RM30,000–50,000/QALY.  

#### 🔍 Sensitivity Analysis

**Sensitivity analysis** tests uncertainty in parameters (e.g., costs, utilities), answering **"How much would conclusions change?"** Types include:  
- **One-way**: Vary one parameter (e.g., drug cost).  
- **Multi-way**: Vary multiple parameters.  
- **Probabilistic**: Use Monte Carlo simulations.  
- **Threshold**: Identify break-even points.  

**Visualization**: **Tornado diagrams** show parameter influence.

#### 🧮 Economic Modeling

**Economic models** simulate clinical/economic processes, using:  
- **Decision Trees**: For short-term decisions.  
- **Markov Models**: For chronic conditions, with **states**, **cycles**, **transition probabilities**, and **utilities/costs**.  

**Example**: Modeling breast cancer to estimate lifetime QALYs.

#### 🩺 Case Study: HER2+ Breast Cancer

**Drug A** (RM60,000, 2.0 QALYs) vs. **Drug B** (RM20,000, 1.5 QALYs):  
- **ICER**: 80,000 RM/QALY.  
- **Interpretation**: Cost-effective at RM100,000/QALY, not at RM50,000/QALY, depending on **budget**, **disease severity**, and **equity**.

#### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

Avoid:  
1. **Inappropriate perspective**: Misaligning costs/outcomes.  
2. **Incorrect costing**: Using outdated prices.  
3. **Inadequate time horizon**: Missing long-term effects.  
4. **No discounting**: Overvaluing future benefits.  
5. **Weak sensitivity analysis**: Ignoring uncertainty.  
6. **ICER misuse**: Omitting comparisons.

Economic evaluation is a cornerstone of health economics, providing a structured framework to guide resource allocation decisions in healthcare. This section introduces the **core concepts**, **learning outcomes**, and **types** of economic evaluation, setting the stage for understanding how to conduct robust evaluations that maximize health outcomes within limited resources. By systematically comparing costs and consequences, economic evaluation ensures **transparent**, **evidence-based**, and **efficient** decision-making in health systems.

### 🌟 What is Economic Evaluation?

**Definition**: Economic evaluation (EE) is **"a comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences"** (Drummond et al., 2005).  
This definition underscores the essence of EE as a tool that weighs both the **resources consumed** and the **health outcomes achieved** to determine the value of health interventions.

- **Core Idea**: EE helps decision-makers **allocate limited resources efficiently** by evaluating both costs and outcomes. It moves beyond simple cost accounting to focus on **value for money**, ensuring that health systems prioritize interventions that deliver the greatest health benefits relative to their costs.
- **Purpose**: EE supports **wise decision-making** in healthcare by systematically comparing the cost and value of interventions. It provides a framework for policymakers, health professionals, and researchers to make **informed choices** about which interventions to adopt, scale, or reject, particularly in resource-constrained environments like Malaysia’s public health system.
- **Applications**: EE is used to assess a wide range of interventions, including **new drugs**, **vaccination programs**, **diagnostic tests**, and **health policies**, ensuring that resources are used to maximize population health.

By providing a **structured** and **transparent** approach, economic evaluation enables health systems to navigate the challenges of **scarcity** and make decisions that are **defensible** and **aligned with health priorities**.

### 📊 Types of Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluations vary based on their **outcome measures** and **decision focus**, allowing flexibility to address different health policy questions. The table below summarizes the **four main types** of economic evaluation, each tailored to specific contexts and goals:

| **Type** | **Outcome Measure** | **Decision Focus** |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **CMA** (Cost-Minimization Analysis) | Same outcomes | Which is cheaper? |
| **CEA** (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis) | Natural units (e.g., life-years gained) | Which gives more health for the cost? |
| **CUA** (Cost-Utility Analysis) | Utility-based (e.g., QALYs, DALYs) | Which gives more value considering quality of life (QoL)? |
| **CBA** (Cost-Benefit Analysis) | Monetary (e.g., RM) | Do the monetary benefits exceed the costs? |

- **Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)**: Used when interventions have **proven identical outcomes**, focusing solely on cost differences. For example, choosing between two bioequivalent generic drugs with different prices.  
  - **Note**: CMA is **rarely used** unless equivalency of outcomes is rigorously proven, as even small differences in effectiveness require other evaluation types.
- **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**: Measures outcomes in **natural units** like life-years gained or cases detected. It is ideal for comparing interventions where **clinical outcomes** are the primary concern, such as screening programs or survival-focused treatments.
- **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)**: Uses **utility-based measures** like Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) or Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) to capture both **quantity** and **quality of life**. CUA is widely used in **Health Technology Assessments (HTA)** due to its comprehensive approach to health outcomes.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**: Converts all outcomes into **monetary values** (e.g., RM), allowing comparisons across health and non-health sectors. For example, assessing a workplace health program’s return on investment through productivity gains.  
  - **Challenge**: Monetizing outcomes like life or suffering is ethically and methodologically complex.

**Key Insight**: The choice of evaluation type depends on the **decision context**, **available data**, and **stakeholder needs**. For instance, Malaysia’s **MaHTAS** often prefers CUA for HTA due to its focus on quality of life, while CBA may be used for cross-sector policy decisions.

**Practical Example**:  
- **CMA**: Comparing two generic antibiotics with identical efficacy to select the cheaper option for a hospital formulary.  
- **CEA**: Evaluating two cancer screening methods based on **cost per case detected** to determine which is more effective for early detection.  
- **CUA**: Assessing a new cancer drug’s **cost per QALY** to balance survival gains with side effects.  
- **CBA**: Analyzing a vaccination program’s **monetary benefits** (e.g., reduced healthcare costs and productivity losses) against its costs.

By understanding these types, you can select the appropriate method to address specific health policy questions, ensuring **relevant** and **actionable** results.

## 🩺 2. Recap of Economic Evaluation Basics

This section revisits the foundational principles and concepts that underpin **economic evaluation (EE)**, providing a critical starting point for understanding how to conduct robust evaluations in healthcare. By exploring **key economic principles** and the **importance of perspective**, we establish the theoretical and practical framework for evaluating health interventions. These concepts ensure that evaluations are **systematic**, **transparent**, and **aligned with decision-making needs**, enabling health systems to allocate limited resources efficiently and equitably.

### ⚖️ Key Economic Principles

Economic evaluations are grounded in fundamental economic concepts that shape how resources are prioritized and allocated in healthcare. **These principles underpin all evaluation frameworks and are essential for decision-making**, providing the theoretical backbone for assessing the value of health interventions. By understanding these principles, you can navigate the complexities of resource scarcity and make **value-driven** decisions that maximize health outcomes.

- **Scarcity**: **Resources are limited, so choices must be made**.  
  - In healthcare, resources such as **money**, **staff**, **time**, **facilities**, and **equipment** are finite, while health needs are virtually unlimited.  
  - **Implication**: Health systems must prioritize interventions, deciding which programs to fund, scale, or discontinue. For example, a health ministry might need to choose between funding a new cancer drug or expanding rural health clinics, as there are not enough resources to do both fully.  
  - **Role in EE**: Economic evaluation helps identify interventions that deliver the greatest health benefits within these constraints, ensuring efficient use of scarce resources.

- **Opportunity Cost**: **The value of the next best alternative foregone**.  
  - Every decision to allocate resources to one intervention means sacrificing the benefits that could have been achieved by investing in another.  
  - **Example**: Spending RM1 million on a new dialysis center may mean forgoing a vaccination program that could prevent thousands of infections. The opportunity cost is the health benefits lost from not implementing the vaccination program.  
  - **Role in EE**: Economic evaluation quantifies these trade-offs, allowing decision-makers to weigh the benefits of the chosen intervention against the value of alternatives, ensuring **informed** and **strategic** resource allocation.

- **Efficiency**: **Maximize health outcomes per unit of resource**.  
  - Efficiency is about achieving the greatest possible health benefits—such as lives saved, diseases prevented, or quality of life improved—for the resources invested.  
  - **Types of Efficiency**:  
    - **Technical Efficiency**: Delivering a specific health outcome at the lowest possible cost (e.g., using generic drugs instead of branded ones to achieve the same therapeutic effect).  
    - **Allocative Efficiency**: Allocating resources to maximize overall population health (e.g., prioritizing vaccinations over rare-disease treatments to benefit more people).  
  - **Role in EE**: Economic evaluation identifies interventions that offer the highest health gains per ringgit spent, promoting both technical and allocative efficiency in healthcare systems.

- **Marginal Analysis**: **Evaluate the incremental cost and effect of a change in resource use**.  
  - Marginal analysis focuses on the additional costs and benefits of small changes in resource allocation, such as scaling up an intervention or modifying its scope.  
  - **Example**: What is the additional cost and benefit of screening 1,000 more people for breast cancer? If the incremental cost is high but the additional cases detected are few, the intervention may not be worth expanding.  
  - **Tool**: The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, defined as:  
    $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{New}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{Comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{New}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{Comparator}}} $$  
    This measures the extra cost per additional unit of health outcome, guiding decisions about whether incremental investments are justified.  
  - **Role in EE**: Marginal analysis ensures that resources are allocated where they generate the most value, fine-tuning decisions to optimize health outcomes.

**Practical Importance**: These principles ensure that economic evaluations are **value-driven** rather than solely cost-driven. By addressing **scarcity**, recognizing **opportunity costs**, promoting **efficiency**, and using **marginal analysis**, evaluations provide a robust framework for prioritizing interventions that deliver the greatest health benefits within limited budgets. For instance, in Malaysia’s public health system, these principles guide decisions about which interventions to include in the **MyHEALTH formulary** or how to allocate resources for **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)** initiatives.

### 👀 The Importance of Perspective

**Economic evaluation is influenced by whose costs and benefits are counted.** The choice of **perspective** determines the scope of costs and outcomes included in the analysis, directly affecting the conclusions drawn. By selecting an appropriate perspective, evaluators ensure that the analysis is **relevant** to the stakeholders and **aligned** with the decision-making context.

The table below summarizes the **common perspectives**, their cost inclusions, and their typical uses:

| **Perspective** | **Costs Included** | **Common Use** |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Societal** | All costs (direct, indirect, intangible) | Academics, broad policy |
| **Health System** | Medical costs to providers | HTA bodies, Ministries of Health |
| **Payer** | Reimbursed costs | Insurers, financing agencies |
| **Patient** | Out-of-pocket, lost income | Equity and affordability studies |

- **Societal Perspective**:  
  - **Scope**: The most comprehensive perspective, capturing **all costs and benefits** across society, including **direct medical costs** (e.g., drugs, hospital stays), **direct non-medical costs** (e.g., patient travel), **indirect costs** (e.g., productivity losses), and **intangible costs** (e.g., pain, emotional distress).  
  - **Use**: Ideal for **macro-level policy decisions**, such as those by **global health agencies** or **academics** studying the total societal impact of interventions. For example, evaluating a national vaccination program’s impact on healthcare costs, productivity, and quality of life.  
  - **Advantages**: Provides a holistic view, ensuring that all impacts are considered.  
  - **Challenges**: Data-intensive and complex, as it requires collecting information across multiple sectors.

- **Health System Perspective**:  
  - **Scope**: Focuses on **direct medical costs** borne by healthcare providers, such as **hospital stays**, **medications**, **staff time**, and **equipment**. Excludes non-medical costs like patient travel or productivity losses.  
  - **Use**: Common in **government budget planning** and **Health Technology Assessments (HTA)** by bodies like Malaysia’s **MaHTAS**, where the focus is on managing public healthcare budgets.  
  - **Example**: Assessing whether a new cancer drug is cost-effective for inclusion in a public hospital’s formulary.  
  - **Advantages**: Streamlined and focused, aligning with the priorities of health ministries and providers.  
  - **Limitations**: May overlook broader societal impacts, such as patient financial burdens.

- **Payer Perspective**:  
  - **Scope**: Includes **reimbursed costs** borne by insurers, government schemes, or employers, such as **claims paid** for medical services or medications.  
  - **Use**: Relevant for **insurance schemes** like Malaysia’s **MySalam** or private insurers evaluating reimbursement policies.  
  - **Example**: Determining whether a new surgical procedure is worth covering based on its cost to the insurer.  
  - **Advantages**: Directly addresses the financial concerns of payers.  
  - **Limitations**: Ignores costs outside the payer’s scope, such as patient out-of-pocket expenses or societal productivity losses.

- **Patient Perspective**:  
  - **Scope**: Focuses on **out-of-pocket costs** (e.g., co-pays, uncovered treatments) and **indirect costs** (e.g., lost income due to illness or caregiving) borne by individuals.  
  - **Use**: Critical for **equity analyses** and studies on **financial hardship**, such as evaluating the affordability of cancer care in Malaysia.  
  - **Example**: Assessing the financial burden of a new treatment on low-income patients.  
  - **Advantages**: Highlights the patient’s experience, addressing issues of access and equity.  
  - **Limitations**: Narrow focus may miss broader health system or societal impacts.

**Key Insight**: **The same intervention can lead to different conclusions depending on the perspective**. For example, a costly new drug may appear **cost-effective** from a societal perspective due to productivity gains but **not cost-effective** from a health system perspective due to budget constraints. Similarly, it may be **financially toxic** for patients due to high out-of-pocket costs. This variability underscores the importance of choosing the perspective that aligns with the **policy question**, **stakeholder needs**, and **data availability**.

**Practical Example**:  
Consider a new targeted therapy for breast cancer:  
- **Societal Perspective**: The high drug cost is offset by improved survival and return to work, making it **cost-effective**.  
- **Health System Perspective**: The drug’s high cost strains the hospital budget, deeming it **not cost-effective**.  
- **Payer Perspective**: High reimbursement costs make it a **low priority** for insurance coverage.  
- **Patient Perspective**: High out-of-pocket costs create **financial toxicity**, limiting access.  

This example illustrates how perspective shapes the evaluation’s focus and outcomes, emphasizing the need to select the perspective carefully to ensure **relevant** and **actionable** results.

## 🛠️ 3. Conducting a Full Economic Evaluation

This section outlines the **methodological framework** for conducting a **full economic evaluation**, a systematic process that ensures **structured, transparent, and policy-relevant** comparisons of health interventions. By following a **10-step process**, evaluators can assess the **costs** and **value** of interventions to support **informed decision-making** in resource-constrained health systems. The section also includes a **practical example** to illustrate how these steps are applied in a real-world scenario, enhancing understanding of their application in public health practice.

### 🔄 Overview of the Process

**A well-conducted economic evaluation is structured, transparent, and policy-relevant.** It systematically compares the cost and value of health interventions to support informed decisions, ensuring that limited resources are allocated efficiently to maximize health outcomes. The process involves **10 key steps**, which provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating interventions, from defining the problem to presenting actionable results. This structured approach is critical for ensuring that evaluations are **reproducible**, **credible**, and **aligned with policy priorities**, making them valuable tools for policymakers, health professionals, and researchers in contexts like Malaysia’s public health system.

### 📋 The 10 Key Steps in Economic Evaluation

The following steps outline the **methodological blueprint** for conducting a full economic evaluation, ensuring that all relevant aspects of an intervention are systematically assessed:

1. **Define the Problem and Comparators**  
   - **Clearly state the health issue or policy question.** This step establishes the focus of the evaluation, ensuring that it addresses a specific, well-defined problem.  
   - **Identify the interventions to be compared (e.g., new treatment vs. standard care).** At least two alternatives must be evaluated to provide a comparative analysis, which is the hallmark of economic evaluation.  
   - **Ensure alternatives are clinically relevant and feasible.** The interventions must be practical and applicable in the real-world context to ensure the evaluation’s relevance.  
   - **Example**: Should the Ministry of Health adopt a new HPV vaccine for boys alongside girls? This question frames the evaluation by comparing the new vaccine program to the existing program for girls, ensuring clinical and policy relevance.

2. **Choose the Perspective**  
   - **Determines which costs and benefits are included.** The perspective shapes the scope of the analysis, focusing on specific stakeholders or society as a whole.  
   - **Common perspectives include:**  
     - **Societal**: All costs and outcomes, including direct, indirect, and intangible costs, providing a comprehensive view.  
     - **Health System**: Direct medical costs, such as those borne by hospitals or clinics, relevant for budget planning.  
     - **Payer**: Reimbursed costs, such as those covered by insurers or government schemes like Malaysia’s MySalam.  
     - **Patient**: Out-of-pocket costs and productivity losses, critical for equity and affordability analyses.  
   - **Impact**: **Perspective affects the interpretation of value.** For instance, a costly intervention may be cost-effective from a societal perspective but not from a health system perspective due to budget constraints.  
   - **Role in EE**: Selecting the appropriate perspective ensures that the evaluation aligns with the decision-maker’s goals and stakeholder needs, enhancing its relevance.

3. **Set the Time Horizon**  
   - **Definition**: The duration over which costs and outcomes are measured.  
   - **Requirement**: **Must be long enough to capture meaningful effects.** The time horizon should reflect the intervention’s expected impact, including short-term and long-term outcomes.  
   - **Variations**:  
     - **Short-term (e.g., 1 year)**: Suitable for acute conditions or interventions with immediate effects, such as treating influenza.  
     - **Long-term (e.g., lifetime for chronic diseases)**: Necessary for conditions like cancer or diabetes, where benefits or costs may emerge over decades.  
   - **Caution**: **A short horizon may miss delayed benefits or costs.** For example, evaluating a cancer treatment over one year may overlook long-term survival gains or recurrence costs, leading to biased conclusions.  
   - **Role in EE**: A well-chosen time horizon ensures that the evaluation captures the full impact of the intervention, avoiding underestimation of its value.

4. **Identify, Measure, and Value Costs**  
   - **Types of Costs**:  
     - **Direct Medical**: Costs incurred by the health system, such as **hospital stays** and **drugs** (e.g., chemotherapy drugs, surgical procedures).  
     - **Direct Non-Medical**: Costs related to accessing care, such as **transport** to healthcare facilities.  
     - **Indirect**: **Lost productivity** due to illness or treatment, such as missed workdays.  
     - **Intangible**: Non-financial costs like **pain** or **emotional distress**, which are hard to quantify but may be considered in societal perspectives.  
   - **Data Sources**: **Real-world data**, **costing studies**, or **tariffs** (e.g., fee schedules, Diagnostic-Related Group tariffs, market prices).  
   - **Importance**: **Accurate cost data is essential for credible economic evaluations.** Inaccurate or incomplete cost estimates can undermine the evaluation’s validity, leading to flawed decisions.  
   - **Role in EE**: This step ensures that all relevant costs are systematically captured, measured, and valued, providing a robust foundation for comparing interventions.

5. **Identify and Measure Outcomes**  
   - **Types of Outcomes**:  
     - **Natural Units**: Measurable health outcomes like **cases detected** or **life-years gained**, used in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA).  
     - **Utility-Based**: Metrics like **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** or **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)**, used in Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA).  
     - **Monetary**: Outcomes converted to monetary values (e.g., RM), used in Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA).  
   - **Requirements**: **Outcomes must be meaningful, measurable, and valid.** They should reflect patient and provider priorities, be quantifiable, and be supported by reliable data.  
   - **Impact**: **Outcome choice determines the type of economic evaluation (CEA, CUA, CBA).** For example, a focus on QALYs necessitates a CUA, while monetary outcomes require a CBA.  
   - **Role in EE**: Selecting appropriate outcomes ensures that the evaluation captures the intervention’s health impact, enabling fair comparisons between alternatives.

6. **Apply Discounting (if needed)**  
   - **Purpose**: **Discounts future costs and outcomes to their present value.** This accounts for the time value of money and health benefits, reflecting societal preferences for immediate gains.  
   - **Common Discount Rates**: $3\%$ to $5\%$, with $3\%$ often used in Malaysia’s Health Technology Assessments (MaHTAS).  
   - **Rationale**: **Reflects time preference ("value now > value later").** People and health systems value benefits received today more than those received in the future.  
   - **Relevance**: **Especially important for long-term or preventive interventions.** For example, vaccines may have benefits that emerge years later, requiring discounting to compare them fairly with immediate costs.  
   - **Role in EE**: Discounting ensures equitable comparisons across interventions with different timeframes, enhancing the accuracy of long-term evaluations.

7. **Conduct Incremental Analysis**  
   - **Purpose**: **Calculates the additional cost and additional benefit of one intervention over another.** This step focuses on the incremental differences between alternatives, rather than their total costs or outcomes.  
   - **Tool**: **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**:  
     $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_A - \text{Cost}_B}{\text{Effect}_A - \text{Effect}_B} $$  
     - **Numerator**: Incremental cost (e.g., RM).  
     - **Denominator**: Incremental effectiveness (e.g., QALYs, life-years gained).  
   - **Comparison**: **Compare ICER against thresholds** (e.g., willingness-to-pay, GDP per capita, or opportunity cost-based thresholds) to assess cost-effectiveness.  
   - **Benefit**: **Helps determine if the extra cost is worth the extra benefit.** For example, an ICER of RM80,000 per QALY indicates the cost of gaining one additional QALY compared to the alternative.  
   - **Role in EE**: Incremental analysis provides a standardized metric for comparing interventions, guiding decisions about whether additional investments are justified.

8. **Perform Sensitivity Analysis**  
   - **Purpose**: **Tests how results change under uncertainty.** Economic evaluations often rely on estimates or assumptions, and sensitivity analysis assesses the robustness of conclusions.  
   - **Types**:  
     - **One-way**: Vary one parameter at a time (e.g., changing drug cost from RM60,000 to RM40,000).  
     - **Multi-way**: Vary multiple parameters simultaneously (e.g., cost and utility values).  
     - **Probabilistic**: Use Monte Carlo simulations to model uncertainty across multiple parameters.  
   - **Benefits**: **Identifies key drivers and ensures robustness of conclusions.** For example, it reveals whether results are sensitive to changes in drug prices or health outcomes.  
   - **Role in EE**: Sensitivity analysis enhances confidence in findings by testing the impact of uncertainty, making evaluations more reliable for policy decisions.

9. **Use Modelling (if applicable)**  
   - **Purpose**: **For complex or long-term decisions.** Models simulate the progression of health conditions and interventions when direct data are limited.  
   - **Tools**:  
     - **Decision Trees**: For **short-term scenarios**, such as choosing between two treatments for an acute condition.  
     - **Markov Models**: For **chronic or recurring conditions**, like cancer or diabetes, where patients transition between health states over time.  
   - **Function**: **Simulates pathways, probabilities, costs, and outcomes** to bridge data gaps and support extrapolation beyond trial periods.  
   - **Role in EE**: Modelling allows evaluators to estimate long-term costs and outcomes, making it essential for chronic diseases or preventive interventions with delayed effects.

10. **Interpret and Present Results**  
    - **Methods**: Use **cost-effectiveness planes**, **league tables**, or **net benefit** to visualize and compare results.  
    - **Requirements**: **Report clearly, transparently, and with context.** Results should be understandable to stakeholders and include assumptions and limitations.  
    - **Goal**: **Align results with policy priorities or resource constraints.** For example, results should inform whether an intervention fits within a health ministry’s budget or national health goals.  
    - **Impact**: **Results must inform action, not just analysis.** A well-presented evaluation guides practical decisions, such as adopting a new intervention or reallocating resources.  
    - **Role in EE**: Clear presentation ensures that findings are actionable, supporting evidence-based policy and practice.

### 🦷 Practical Example: Mobile Dental Clinic

**Scenario**: The Ministry of Health is considering adding a mobile dental clinic to rural areas to address **limited rural access to dental care**. This example illustrates how the **10 steps** are applied in a real-world public health context, comparing a **mobile dental clinic** to a **fixed subsidy scheme** for dental care access.

The table below outlines the application of each step:

| **Step** | **Example** |
|----------|-------------|
| **Define Problem** | Limited rural access to dental care; compare mobile clinic vs. fixed subsidy scheme |
| **Perspective** | Health system perspective |
| **Time Horizon** | 5 years |
| **Identify Costs** | Mobile van purchase, fuel, salaries vs. per-patient subsidies |
| **Identify Outcomes** | Cavities treated, QALYs gained |
| **Discounting** | Apply $3\%$ per annum |
| **Incremental Analysis** | ICER = RM per cavity treated or RM per QALY |
| **Sensitivity Analysis** | Test variation in staff costs, fuel prices |
| **Modeling** | Use decision tree if data are incomplete |
| **Interpretation** | Present ICER relative to GDP |

- **Define Problem**: The evaluation focuses on addressing **limited rural access to dental care**, comparing a **mobile dental clinic** (a van that travels to rural areas) to a **fixed subsidy scheme** (subsidizing patient visits to existing clinics). This ensures the evaluation addresses a specific, policy-relevant question.  
- **Perspective**: The **health system perspective** is chosen, focusing on costs borne by the Ministry of Health, such as equipment and staff salaries, rather than patient travel costs.  
- **Time Horizon**: A **5-year horizon** is selected to capture the operational costs and health benefits of the mobile clinic, balancing short-term implementation with medium-term outcomes.  
- **Identify Costs**: Costs include **mobile van purchase**, **fuel**, and **salaries** for the clinic, compared to **per-patient subsidies** for the fixed scheme.  
- **Identify Outcomes**: Outcomes are **cavities treated** (a natural unit for CEA) and **QALYs gained** (for CUA), reflecting health improvements from better dental care access.  
- **Discounting**: A **$3\%$ per annum** discount rate is applied to adjust future costs and outcomes to their present value, accounting for time preference.  
- **Incremental Analysis**: The **ICER** is calculated as the cost per cavity treated or per QALY gained, comparing the mobile clinic to the subsidy scheme to determine which is more cost-effective.  
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Tests variations in **staff costs** and **fuel prices** to assess the robustness of the ICER under uncertainty.  
- **Modeling**: A **decision tree** is used if data are incomplete, simulating possible outcomes like treatment success or failure rates.  
- **Interpretation**: The ICER is presented **relative to Malaysia’s GDP per capita** (e.g., ~RM50,000 per QALY) to determine if the mobile clinic is cost-effective, informing policy decisions.

**Practical Importance**: This example demonstrates how the 10 steps provide a **systematic framework** for evaluating real-world interventions. By applying these steps, the policy-maker can make an **evidence-based decision** about whether a mobile dental clinic offers better value than a subsidy scheme, ensuring efficient use of resources to improve rural health access.

## 💰 3. Understanding Costs in Economic Evaluation

Understanding and accurately assessing **costs** is a cornerstone of economic evaluation, as it ensures that the resources consumed by health interventions are systematically captured and compared. This section explores the **definition of cost**, **types of costs**, the **costing process**, and the **approaches to costing**, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating the financial implications of interventions. By mastering these concepts, you will be equipped to conduct **credible** and **policy-relevant** economic evaluations that support **efficient** resource allocation in healthcare systems like Malaysia’s.

### 📈 Definition of Cost

**Cost** is the **value of resources consumed to deliver an intervention or service**. In economic evaluation, costs represent the **economic burden** of implementing a health intervention, encompassing not just financial expenditures but also other resources like time, personnel, and infrastructure.  

- **Core Principle**: **Economic evaluation requires systematic identification, measurement, and valuation of costs** to accurately reflect spending from the relevant perspective. This ensures that the evaluation captures the full scope of resource use, whether from the perspective of the health system, society, payers, or patients.  
- **Importance**: Accurate cost assessment is critical for comparing interventions and determining their **value for money**. Without precise cost data, evaluations risk underestimating or overestimating the financial impact, leading to flawed policy decisions.  
- **Application**: Costs must be tailored to the **chosen perspective** (e.g., societal, health system) to align with the decision-maker’s goals, ensuring relevance and applicability in contexts like Malaysia’s public health system.

### 🗂️ Types of Costs

**Costs are categorized based on their nature and impact**, allowing evaluators to systematically account for all resources consumed by an intervention. The table below summarizes the **four main types of costs** with medical examples, providing clarity on their scope and relevance:

| **Cost Type** | **Description** | **Medical Example** |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Direct Medical** | Costs incurred by the health system/provider | Chemotherapy drugs, oncologist fees, infusion room, lab tests |
| **Direct Non-Medical** | Non-medical expenses due to seeking care | Patient travel to oncology center, parking, accommodation near hospital |
| **Indirect** | Productivity losses due to illness or treatment | Sick leave during chemo cycles, early retirement due to fatigue |
| **Intangible** | Non-financial costs hard to quantify | Anxiety, pain, hair loss stigma, emotional distress |

- **Direct Medical Costs**: These are expenses directly related to healthcare delivery, borne by the health system or provider.  
  - **Examples**: Costs of **chemotherapy drugs**, **oncologist fees**, **infusion room usage**, and **lab tests** for cancer treatment.  
  - **Relevance**: Critical for **health system** or **provider perspectives**, as they reflect the direct financial burden on healthcare facilities.  
- **Direct Non-Medical Costs**: These are non-healthcare expenses incurred by patients or families to access care.  
  - **Examples**: **Patient travel** to an oncology center, **parking fees**, or **accommodation costs** for treatment far from home.  
  - **Relevance**: Included in **societal** or **patient perspectives**, as they capture the broader economic impact on individuals seeking care.  
- **Indirect Costs**: These reflect productivity losses due to illness or treatment, affecting patients or caregivers.  
  - **Examples**: **Sick leave** during chemotherapy cycles or **early retirement** due to treatment-related fatigue.  
  - **Relevance**: Important for **societal** or **patient perspectives**, as they account for economic impacts outside the healthcare system.  
- **Intangible Costs**: These are non-financial costs that are difficult to quantify, such as emotional or psychological impacts.  
  - **Examples**: **Anxiety**, **pain**, **hair loss stigma**, or **emotional distress** from cancer treatment.  
  - **Relevance**: Typically considered in **societal perspectives** but rarely monetized due to measurement challenges.  

**Key Insight**: The types of costs included depend on the **perspective** of the evaluation. For example, a **health system perspective** focuses solely on direct medical costs, while a **societal perspective** encompasses all cost types, ensuring a comprehensive assessment.

### 🔍 The Costing Process: 3 Steps

The costing process is a **systematic approach** to capturing the resources consumed by an intervention, ensuring accuracy and relevance in economic evaluations. It involves **three key steps**: **identification**, **measurement**, and **valuation**, each critical for producing credible cost estimates.

1. **Identification**  
   - **Question**: **What resources are used?**  
   - **Action**: **List all relevant resource items for the intervention and comparator.** This step involves identifying every resource consumed, from medical supplies to patient travel, ensuring no relevant costs are overlooked.  
   - **Example**: For a chemotherapy program, resources include the **number of chemo sessions**, **blood tests**, and **clinic visits**. Both the intervention (e.g., new drug) and comparator (e.g., standard chemo) must be considered to ensure a comprehensive comparison.  
   - **Role in EE**: Identification sets the scope of the cost analysis, aligning it with the evaluation’s perspective and objectives.

2. **Measurement**  
   - **Question**: **How much was used?**  
   - **Action**: **Quantify resource use** (e.g., number of visits, days hospitalized) to determine the volume of resources consumed.  
   - **Data Sources**: **Patient records**, **surveys**, or **administrative databases** provide reliable data for quantifying resource use.  
   - **Example**: A chemotherapy program might involve **6 cycles of chemo** and **12 blood tests** per patient, based on clinical records or trial data.  
   - **Role in EE**: Measurement ensures that the quantity of resources is accurately captured, providing a foundation for valuation.

3. **Valuation**  
   - **Action**: **Assign a monetary value to each resource unit.** This step converts resource use into monetary terms, enabling cost comparisons.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - RM1,500 per chemo cycle.  
     - RM80 per lab test.  
     - RM50 per outpatient visit.  
   - **Sources**: **Standard prices** such as **fee schedules**, **Diagnostic-Related Group (DRG) tariffs**, **market prices**, or **published cost studies** ensure consistency and reliability.  
   - **Role in EE**: Valuation translates resource use into financial terms, allowing evaluators to calculate total costs and compare interventions accurately.

**Practical Importance**: The **three-step costing process** ensures that costs are **systematically identified, measured, and valued**, providing a robust foundation for economic evaluations. For example, in Malaysia’s public health system, this process is used to estimate the costs of interventions like cancer screening programs, ensuring that budget allocations are based on accurate and transparent data.

### ⚖️ Micro-Costing vs. Gross-Costing

The approach to costing affects the **precision** and **effort** required in an economic evaluation. **Micro-costing** and **gross-costing** represent two distinct methods, each suited to different contexts. The table below compares these approaches:

| **Approach** | **Description** | **Use When...** |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Micro-Costing** | Itemize and value each resource in detail | High precision needed (e.g., alongside clinical trials) |
| **Gross-Costing** | Use average cost per service unit | Budget planning, secondary data |

- **Micro-Costing**:  
  - **Description**: Involves **itemizing and valuing each resource in detail**, such as the cost of individual drugs, staff time per procedure, or equipment use per patient.  
  - **Use When**: **High precision is needed**, such as in **clinical trials** where detailed cost data are collected alongside efficacy data.  
  - **Advantages**: Provides **high accuracy** and granularity, capturing the true cost of complex interventions.  
  - **Challenges**: **Time-consuming** and resource-intensive, requiring extensive data collection and analysis.  
  - **Example**: Calculating the exact cost of a chemotherapy regimen by itemizing drug doses, infusion time, and lab tests.

- **Gross-Costing**:  
  - **Description**: Uses **average cost per service unit**, such as the cost per hospital day or per outpatient visit, without breaking down individual components.  
  - **Use When**: Suitable for **budget planning** or when relying on **secondary data**, such as national cost databases.  
  - **Advantages**: **Quicker** and less resource-intensive, making it practical for large-scale or preliminary analyses.  
  - **Challenges**: **Less detailed**, potentially missing variations in resource use across patients or settings.  
  - **Example**: Using an average cost of RM2,000 per chemotherapy session based on hospital billing data.

**Key Insight**: **Micro-costing is more precise but time-consuming, while gross-costing is quicker but less detailed.** The choice between these approaches depends on the evaluation’s goals, available data, and resource constraints. For instance, Malaysia’s **MaHTAS** might use micro-costing for detailed HTA studies but gross-costing for rapid budget estimates.

### 🩺 Example: Costing for HER2+ Breast Cancer

**Policy Question**: **Is Drug A (new monoclonal antibody) more cost-effective than Drug B (standard chemo) for HER2+ breast cancer?** This example illustrates how the costing process is applied in a real-world health evaluation, highlighting the importance of perspective and accuracy.

**Costs to Consider**:  
- **Drug Acquisition**: RM5,000 per cycle for Drug A vs. RM1,200 per cycle for Drug B.  
- **Pre-Medication & Monitoring Labs**: Costs for drugs to manage side effects and lab tests to monitor patient health.  
- **Management of Side Effects**: Costs for treating adverse events, such as **febrile neutropenia admission** due to chemotherapy toxicity.  
- **Patient Travel and Lost Income**: Included if using a **societal** or **patient perspective**, capturing costs like transportation to treatment centers or lost wages due to treatment time.  

**Key Principle**: **Accurate costing requires understanding what resources are used, how much, at what price, and from whose perspective.**  
- **What Resources**: Identify all relevant resources, such as drugs, lab tests, and hospital visits for both Drug A and Drug B.  
- **How Much**: Measure resource use, e.g., 6 cycles of Drug A vs. 8 cycles of Drug B, based on clinical protocols.  
- **At What Price**: Assign monetary values using standard sources, e.g., RM5,000 per cycle for Drug A based on market prices.  
- **Whose Perspective**: The choice of perspective (e.g., health system vs. societal) determines which costs are included. For example, a **health system perspective** excludes travel and lost income, while a **societal perspective** includes them.  

**Practical Importance**: This example demonstrates how the costing process ensures **transparency** and **accuracy** in economic evaluations. By systematically assessing costs for Drug A and Drug B, evaluators can determine which intervention offers better value, informing decisions about inclusion in Malaysia’s **formulary** or other funding priorities.

  - **Example**: Assessing the financial impact of cancer treatment on low-income patients in Malaysia.  
  - **Advantages**: Highlights **equity** and **affordability**, addressing the patient’s experience and potential financial hardship.  
  - **Challenges**: Narrow focus may miss broader health system or societal impacts.

**Practical Importance**: The choice of perspective ensures that the evaluation is **tailored to the stakeholder’s needs**, such as budget planning for health ministries or affordability for patients. In Malaysia, for instance, a **health system perspective** is often used for **MaHTAS evaluations**, while a **patient perspective** is critical for addressing **health equity** in programs like Peka B40.

### 💊 Example: HER2+ Breast Cancer Treatment

This example illustrates how different perspectives affect the costs considered in evaluating treatments for **HER2+ breast cancer**, highlighting the practical implications of perspective choice. The table below shows which **cost items** are included under each perspective:

| **Cost Item** | **Included in...** |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Drug price (RM per cycle) | All perspectives |
| Blood tests, infusion costs | Provider, Payer, Societal |
| Travel to cancer center | Patient, Societal |
| Lost income from work | Patient, Societal |

- **Drug Price (RM per cycle)**: Included in **all perspectives**, as it represents a core cost of treatment, whether borne by the health system, payer, patient (via co-pays), or society.  
- **Blood Tests, Infusion Costs**: Included in **Provider**, **Payer**, and **Societal** perspectives, as these are medical costs incurred by hospitals, reimbursed by insurers, or aggregated in societal analyses.  
- **Travel to Cancer Center**: Included in **Patient** and **Societal** perspectives, as it represents a non-medical cost borne by patients accessing treatment.  
- **Lost Income from Work**: Included in **Patient** and **Societal** perspectives, capturing productivity losses due to treatment-related absences.  

**Application**: For a HER2+ breast cancer treatment, a **health system perspective** would focus on drug and infusion costs, while a **patient perspective** would emphasize travel and income losses, reflecting different priorities. This example underscores the need to align the perspective with the evaluation’s goals, such as budgeting or equity analysis.

### ⚖️ Implications: Same Intervention, Different Conclusions

**Comparing Drug A (targeted therapy) vs. Drug B (standard chemotherapy)** illustrates how perspective shapes the conclusions of an economic evaluation. The table below summarizes the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** interpretations for each perspective:

| **Perspective** | **ICER Interpretation** |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| **Societal** | High drug cost offset by return to work → **Cost-effective** |
| **Health System** | Costly intervention without enough budget impact benefit → **Not cost-effective** |
| **Patient** | High out-of-pocket costs → **Financially toxic** |
| **Payer** | High reimbursement claim burden → **Low priority** |

- **Societal Perspective**: **High drug cost offset by return to work → Cost-effective.** The high cost of Drug A (targeted therapy) is justified by benefits like improved survival and productivity gains, which reduce societal costs (e.g., less caregiver burden or lost income). This perspective often favors interventions with broad societal benefits.  
- **Health System Perspective**: **Costly intervention without enough budget impact benefit → Not cost-effective.** Drug A’s high cost strains hospital budgets, and the health system may not see sufficient financial returns within its scope, making it less viable for public funding.  
- **Patient Perspective**: **High out-of-pocket costs → Financially toxic.** Even with subsidies, Drug A may require significant patient co-pays, creating financial hardship, especially for low-income patients in Malaysia.  
- **Payer Perspective**: **High reimbursement claim burden → Low priority.** The high cost of Drug A leads to substantial claims for insurers, making it less attractive for reimbursement compared to cheaper alternatives like Drug B.

**Key Insight**: **The choice of perspective can lead to different conclusions for the same intervention.** For example, Drug A may be deemed **cost-effective** from a societal perspective due to long-term benefits but **not cost-effective** from a health system perspective due to immediate budget constraints. This variability highlights the importance of selecting a perspective that aligns with the **policy question** (e.g., national formulary inclusion) and **stakeholder needs** (e.g., patients, insurers).

**Practical Importance**: In Malaysia’s context, choosing the right perspective is critical for evaluations conducted by **MaHTAS** (for Sexually Transmitted Diseases) or other health authorities. A **societal perspective** might be used for broad policy decisions, while a **patient perspective** could inform programs like **Peka B40** to address equity. The choice ensures that evaluations are **relevant** and **actionable**, guiding decisions that balance efficiency, equity, and affordability.

## 📊 5. Outcomes in Economic Evaluation

**Outcomes** are the heart of economic evaluation, capturing the **health benefits** or **consequences** of interventions. This section explores the **definition of outcomes**, the **types of outcome measures**, their **applications** in different evaluation types, the **concept of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**, and **methods for measuring utilities**. By understanding how outcomes are selected and measured, you will be equipped to assess the **value** of health interventions accurately, ensuring evaluations are **meaningful** and **relevant** to stakeholders in contexts like Malaysia’s public health system.

### 🌟 What are Outcomes?

**Outcomes represent the consequences of an intervention on health.** They quantify the **health benefits** achieved, such as improved survival, reduced disease burden, or enhanced quality of life, and are critical for comparing interventions in economic evaluations.  

- **Core Principle**: Outcomes are **measured differently depending on the type of economic evaluation**. The choice of outcome measure—whether natural units, utility-based metrics, or monetary values—determines the evaluation type (e.g., CEA, CUA, CBA) and aligns with the evaluation’s objectives.  
- **Importance**: Outcomes provide the **benefit side** of the cost-effectiveness equation, enabling decision-makers to assess whether an intervention’s health gains justify its costs.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, outcomes are used to evaluate interventions like cancer treatments or vaccination programs, ensuring that resources are allocated to interventions that maximize health impact.

### 📏 Types of Outcome Measures

The choice of outcome measure is tied to the **perspective** and **evaluation type**, ensuring that the analysis captures the most relevant health impacts. The table below maps **perspectives** to **outcome types** and their use in economic evaluations:

| **Perspective** | **Costs Included** | **Outcome Type** | **Used In** |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Societal** | All costs (direct, indirect, intangible) | Natural units | CEA |
| **Health System/Provider** | Direct medical costs only | Utility-based | CUA |
| **Payer** | Reimbursed/claimable medical expenses | Monetary | CBA |

- **Natural Units (CEA)**: Used in **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**, these are measurable health outcomes like **life-years gained**, **cases detected**, or **hospitalizations avoided**.  
  - **Example**: A breast cancer screening program might measure outcomes as **cases detected**, focusing on clinical effectiveness.  
  - **Relevance**: Ideal for evaluations where **quantity of health** (e.g., survival) is the primary concern, often used in **societal perspectives** to capture broad health impacts.  
- **Utility-Based (CUA)**: Used in **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)**, these metrics, such as **QALYs** or **DALYs**, combine **quantity** and **quality of life**.  
  - **Example**: A cancer treatment’s impact might be measured in **QALYs**, accounting for both survival and side effects.  
  - **Relevance**: Common in **health system/provider perspectives**, especially for Health Technology Assessments (e.g., Malaysia’s MaHTAS), as they capture patient well-being.  
- **Monetary (CBA)**: Used in **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**, outcomes are converted to **monetary values** (e.g., RM), such as productivity gains or healthcare cost savings.  
  - **Example**: A workplace wellness program might measure outcomes as **RM value of reduced sick leave**.  
  - **Relevance**: Used in **payer perspectives** or cross-sector analyses, allowing comparisons with non-health interventions but raising ethical challenges in monetizing health.

**Practical Importance**: The choice of outcome measure ensures that the evaluation aligns with the **decision context** and **stakeholder needs**, such as clinical effectiveness for providers or financial returns for payers.

### 🩺 Example: Breast Cancer Outcomes

This example illustrates how different outcome measures are applied when **comparing Drug A (targeted therapy) vs. Drug B (standard chemotherapy)** for HER2+ breast cancer, highlighting their relevance to specific evaluation types:

| **Evaluation** | **Outcome Used** | **Why It Matters** |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **CEA** | Life-years gained | Drug A improves survival by 8 months |
| **CUA** | QALYs | Drug A improves survival with fewer side effects, enhancing QoL |
| **CBA** | RM value of productivity | Drug A allows earlier return to work |

- **CEA (Life-Years Gained)**:  
  - **Outcome**: **Drug A improves survival by 8 months** compared to Drug B.  
  - **Why It Matters**: This outcome focuses on **quantity of life**, making it suitable for CEA, where the goal is to compare survival gains relative to costs. For example, policymakers might use this to assess whether Drug A’s survival benefit justifies its higher cost.  
- **CUA (QALYs)**:  
  - **Outcome**: **Drug A improves survival with fewer side effects, enhancing quality of life (QoL).**  
  - **Why It Matters**: QALYs capture both **survival** and **well-being**, making CUA ideal for interventions where side effects significantly impact patients. In Malaysia, CUA is often used by **MaHTAS** to evaluate treatments like targeted therapies.  
- **CBA (RM Value of Productivity)**:  
  - **Outcome**: **Drug A allows earlier return to work**, reducing productivity losses.  
  - **Why It Matters**: By converting outcomes to monetary values, CBA enables comparisons across sectors (e.g., health vs. education), but monetizing health benefits can be controversial.

**Application**: This example shows how outcome choice shapes the evaluation’s focus. For instance, a **health system perspective** might prioritize QALYs for CUA, while a **societal perspective** might include productivity gains for CBA, ensuring relevance to the evaluation’s goals.

### 🕒 What is a QALY? (Quality-Adjusted Life Year)

**Definition**: A **Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY)** **combines length of life and quality of life** on a scale from $0$ (death) to $1$ (perfect health). It is a widely used metric in **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)** to assess interventions where quality of life is a significant factor.

- **Examples**:  
  - **1 year of life at full health = $1$ QALY.** This represents a year lived in perfect health, with no impairments.  
  - **1 year of life with side effects (utility = $0.6$) = $0.6$ QALYs.** For example, a year lived with chemotherapy-related side effects reduces the QALY value based on the impact on quality of life.  
- **Use**: **CUA is useful when quality of life is significantly affected** (e.g., chemotherapy vs. targeted therapy). QALYs allow evaluators to balance survival gains with side effects, making them ideal for assessing treatments with significant impacts on patient well-being, such as cancer therapies in Malaysia’s public health system.  
- **Importance**: QALYs provide a **standardized measure** that integrates both **quantity** and **quality of life**, enabling fair comparisons across interventions. They are widely used in **Health Technology Assessments** globally and by Malaysia’s **MaHTAS**.

### 📋 How are Utilities Measured?

**Utilities** reflect the **quality of life** associated with specific health states, forming the basis for calculating QALYs. They are measured on a scale from $0$ (death) to $1$ (perfect health) and are derived using various methods. The table below summarizes **common measurement methods**:

| **Method** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| **EQ-5D** | Standardized tool for health states |
| **Time Trade-Off** | Time willing to trade for better health |
| **Standard Gamble** | Risk willing to accept for full health |

- **EQ-5D**:  
  - A **standardized tool** that assesses health states across five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression).  
  - **Example**: A patient with cancer might report moderate pain and anxiety, yielding a utility score of $0.7$.  
  - **Relevance**: Widely used due to its simplicity and validated scoring system, often applied in clinical trials and population studies.  
- **Time Trade-Off (TTO)**:  
  - Measures the **time a patient is willing to trade** for better health. For example, a patient might prefer 8 years in perfect health over 10 years with chronic pain.  
  - **Example**: If a patient trades 2 years of a 10-year lifespan for perfect health, the utility is $8/10 = 0.8$.  
  - **Relevance**: Captures patient preferences for quality over quantity of life, useful for chronic conditions.  
- **Standard Gamble (SG)**:  
  - Measures the **risk a patient is willing to accept** for full health. For example, a patient might accept a 20% risk of death for a chance at perfect health.  
  - **Example**: If a patient accepts a 20% risk, the utility is $1 - 0.2 = 0.8$.  
  - **Relevance**: Reflects patient risk preferences, often used in high-stakes health decisions.  

**Note**: **Studies may use published utility weights or collect new data from patients.**  
- **Published Utility Weights**: Derived from large-scale studies (e.g., EQ-5D databases) and applied to similar populations, ensuring consistency.  
- **New Data Collection**: Involves surveying patients directly to capture context-specific utilities, particularly for unique interventions or populations.  

**Practical Importance**: Accurate utility measurement ensures that QALYs reflect the true impact of interventions on patient well-being, making CUAs reliable for decision-making in settings like Malaysia’s health system.

## ⏰ 6. Timing and Discounting

The **timing** of costs and outcomes in economic evaluations significantly influences their assessment, as the value of future benefits and costs differs from those occurring immediately. This section explores **why timing matters**, the **concept of discounting**, **standard discount rates**, the **definition of time horizon**, and their **implications** for evaluating health interventions. By understanding these concepts, you will be equipped to ensure **fair comparisons** between interventions with varying timeframes, making evaluations **robust** and **policy-relevant**, particularly in contexts like Malaysia’s healthcare system.

### 🕰️ Why Does Timing Matter?

**Future costs and outcomes are worth less than immediate ones due to time preference in economics.** This reflects the fundamental economic principle that people and health systems value benefits received now more than those in the future.

- **Rationale**: **People value benefits now more than later.** This **time preference** arises because immediate benefits provide instant utility, while future benefits are uncertain and less impactful in present decision-making. For example, a patient may prefer immediate pain relief over a treatment that improves health years later.  
- **Importance**: Timing affects how costs and outcomes are valued in economic evaluations. Interventions with delayed benefits, such as preventive programs, require careful adjustment to compare fairly with those offering immediate results.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, timing is critical when evaluating interventions like **vaccination programs**, where costs are incurred upfront but benefits (e.g., disease prevention) occur years later, necessitating methods like discounting to ensure equitable assessments.

### 💸 What is Discounting?

**Definition**: **A method to adjust future costs and outcomes to their present value.** Discounting accounts for time preference by reducing the value of future costs and benefits to reflect their worth in today’s terms.

- **Application**: **Applied when the time horizon exceeds 1 year.** Discounting is essential for evaluations spanning multiple years, as it ensures that long-term costs and outcomes are comparable to immediate ones.  
- **Purpose**: **Ensures fair comparison between interventions with different timing of costs and benefits.** For example, a cancer treatment with high upfront costs but long-term survival gains must be discounted to compare fairly with a cheaper, short-term alternative.  
- **Importance**: Discounting prevents overvaluing future benefits, making evaluations more accurate and relevant for decision-making in resource-constrained settings like Malaysia’s public health system.

### 📉 Standard Discount Rates

The choice of discount rate is critical in economic evaluations, as it determines how much future values are reduced. The table below summarizes **common discount rates** used in different contexts:

| **Context**                             | **Common Rate**                              |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **High-income settings (e.g., UK, US)** | $3\%$ annually                               |
| **LMIC guidelines/WHO**                 | $3\% - 5\%$                                  |
| **Malaysian HTA (MaHTAS)**              | Often uses $3\%$ for both costs and benefits |

- **High-income settings (e.g., UK, US)**: Typically use a **$3\%$ annual discount rate**, reflecting stable economic conditions and established guidelines (e.g., NICE in the UK).  
- **LMIC guidelines/WHO**: Recommend a range of **$3\% - 5\%$**, accounting for economic variability in low- and middle-income countries.  
- **Malaysian HTA (MaHTAS)**: **Often uses $3\%$ for both costs and benefits**, aligning with international standards while reflecting Malaysia’s economic context.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, a $3\%$ discount rate is commonly applied in **Health Technology Assessments (HTA)** to evaluate interventions like new drugs or screening programs, ensuring consistency and comparability.

### 🩺 Example: Breast Cancer Case

This example illustrates the impact of **discounting** on a breast cancer treatment evaluation, comparing outcomes **without and with a $3\%$ discount rate**. The table below summarizes the results:

| **Metric** | **Without Discounting** | **With Discounting ($3\%$)** |
|------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Survival Gain** | $0.8$ QALYs | $\approx 0.76$ QALYs |
| **Future Productivity Gains** | RM20,000 | $\approx$ RM18,500 |

- **Survival Gain**:  
  - **Without Discounting**: A treatment yields **$0.8$ QALYs**, representing 8 months of quality-adjusted life without adjustment.  
  - **With Discounting ($3\%$)**: The present value is reduced to **$\approx 0.76$ QALYs**, reflecting the lower value of future health benefits.  
- **Future Productivity Gains**:  
  - **Without Discounting**: Future productivity gains are valued at **RM20,000**, assuming no time preference.  
  - **With Discounting ($3\%$)**: The present value is reduced to **$\approx$ RM18,500**, accounting for the decreased value of future financial benefits.  
- **Key Insight**: **Discounting reduces both future health and financial benefits.** This adjustment ensures that long-term outcomes are fairly compared to immediate ones, preventing overestimation of future gains.

**Application**: In Malaysia, discounting is critical for evaluating interventions like **targeted cancer therapies**, where high upfront costs are weighed against long-term survival and productivity gains, ensuring accurate cost-effectiveness assessments.

### ⏳ What is a Time Horizon?

**Definition**: The **length of time over which costs and outcomes are measured in an evaluation.** The time horizon determines the scope of the analysis, ensuring that all relevant costs and benefits are captured.

- **Choosing an Appropriate Time Horizon**: The table below outlines recommended time horizons for different scenarios:

| **Scenario** | **Recommended Horizon** |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| **Acute illness (e.g., influenza)** | 1 year or less |
| **Chronic disease (e.g., cancer, diabetes)** | Lifetime or long-term (10–20 years) |
| **Preventive intervention** | Until key outcomes occur (e.g., cancer incidence avoided) |

- **Acute Illness (e.g., influenza)**: A **1-year or less** horizon is sufficient, as costs and outcomes occur rapidly. For example, evaluating a flu treatment focuses on immediate recovery and costs.  
- **Chronic Disease (e.g., cancer, diabetes)**: A **lifetime or long-term (10–20 years)** horizon is needed to capture ongoing costs (e.g., treatment, monitoring) and benefits (e.g., survival, quality of life).  
- **Preventive Intervention**: The horizon should extend **until key outcomes occur**, such as cancer incidence avoided in a vaccination program, which may require decades to fully manifest.  
- **Importance**: The time horizon must be **long enough to capture meaningful effects**, ensuring that the evaluation reflects the intervention’s full impact.

### 🩺 Implications for Breast Cancer Evaluation

The choice of time horizon significantly affects the evaluation of a breast cancer treatment, as illustrated below:

- **Short Horizon (1–2 years)**: **Captures only drug costs, not full survival gains.** A short horizon focuses on immediate costs (e.g., drug administration) but misses long-term benefits like extended survival or reduced recurrence, leading to an incomplete assessment.  
- **Lifetime Horizon**: **Captures long-term benefits like reduced recurrence, survival, and return to work.** A longer horizon accounts for the full impact of the treatment, such as improved quality of life and productivity gains, providing a more comprehensive evaluation.  
- **Caution**: **Underestimating the time horizon can bias against long-term, high-impact interventions like Drug A.** For example, a 1-year horizon for a targeted therapy may show high costs without capturing its survival benefits, unfairly deeming it not cost-effective.  

**Practical Importance**: In Malaysia’s context, choosing an appropriate time horizon is critical for evaluating **chronic disease treatments** or **preventive programs**. A lifetime horizon ensures that interventions like cancer therapies or HPV vaccinations are fairly assessed, capturing their long-term value for health systems like **MaHTAS** or programs like **Peka B40**.

## 📈 7. Incremental Analysis and ICER

**Incremental analysis** is a cornerstone of economic evaluation, enabling decision-makers to compare the **additional costs** and **benefits** of one health intervention over another. This section explores the **definition of incremental analysis**, the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, **thresholds** for interpreting cost-effectiveness, and their **application** in real-world scenarios, such as evaluating cancer treatments in Malaysia. By mastering these concepts, you will be equipped to assess whether the additional costs of an intervention are justified by its health benefits, supporting **evidence-based** and **policy-relevant** decisions in resource-constrained health systems.

### 🔍 What is Incremental Analysis?

**Definition**: **Incremental analysis compares the additional cost and additional benefit of one intervention versus another.** It focuses on the **differences** in costs and outcomes between two options, rather than their total values, to determine the value of adopting a new intervention.

- **Question Answered**: **"How much more are we paying for each additional unit of outcome?"** This question is critical for understanding whether the extra cost of a new intervention is worth the additional health benefit it provides.  
- **Importance**: Incremental analysis ensures that decision-makers focus on the **incremental value** of an intervention, avoiding misleading conclusions based on total costs or outcomes alone.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, incremental analysis is used to evaluate interventions like new cancer drugs or vaccination programs, helping bodies like **MaHTAS** decide whether to include them in public health systems.

### 📝 ICER Formula

The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** is the key metric in incremental analysis, quantifying the cost per additional unit of health outcome. It is calculated as:

$$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{New}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{Comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{New}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{Comparator}}} $$

- **Numerator**: **Incremental cost (RM)**, representing the additional cost of the new intervention compared to the comparator.  
- **Denominator**: **Incremental effectiveness** (e.g., QALYs, life-years gained), representing the additional health benefit.  
- **Purpose**: The ICER provides a standardized measure to compare the cost-effectiveness of interventions, enabling decision-makers to assess whether the extra cost is justified by the extra benefit.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia’s health system, ICERs are used to evaluate interventions for inclusion in the **MyHEALTH formulary**, ensuring resources are allocated efficiently.

### 🩺 Example: HER2+ Breast Cancer Drug Evaluation

This example illustrates how incremental analysis and ICER are applied to evaluate **Drug A (targeted therapy)** versus **Drug B (standard chemotherapy)** for HER2+ breast cancer. The table below presents the data:

| **Option** | **Cost (RM)** | **QALYs Gained** |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Drug B (Standard)** | 20,000 | 1.5 |
| **Drug A (Targeted)** | 60,000 | 2.0 |

**ICER Calculation**:

$$ \text{ICER} = \frac{60,000 - 20,000}{2.0 - 1.5} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = 80,000 \, \text{RM per QALY} $$

- **Incremental Cost**: RM60,000 - RM20,000 = **RM40,000**.  
- **Incremental Effectiveness**: 2.0 - 1.5 = **0.5 QALYs**.  
- **Result**: The ICER of **80,000 RM per QALY** indicates that adopting Drug A costs an additional RM80,000 for each additional QALY gained compared to Drug B.  
- **Application**: This ICER helps policymakers determine whether Drug A’s additional benefits justify its higher cost, guiding decisions about its inclusion in Malaysia’s public health system.

### 🤔 How to Interpret the ICER?

Interpreting the ICER involves comparing it to a **threshold** to determine cost-effectiveness:

- **If ICER < threshold**: The intervention is **cost-effective**, meaning the additional cost is justified by the health benefits.  
- **If ICER > threshold**: It may **not be cost-effective**, depending on the context, such as budget constraints or intervention priority.  
- **Threshold Determinants**:  
  - **National Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) thresholds**: Reflect how much a health system is willing to pay for a health gain, often based on policy priorities.  
  - **GDP-based benchmarks**: Use economic indicators like GDP per capita to set informal thresholds.  
  - **Opportunity cost in the health system**: Consider what health benefits are forgone when resources are allocated to the new intervention.  

**Importance**: The ICER’s interpretation depends on the **context** and **threshold**, ensuring that decisions align with health system goals and resource availability.

### 💰 Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) Threshold

**Definition**: The **WTP threshold reflects how much a health system or society is willing to pay for an additional unit of health gain (e.g., 1 QALY)**.  

- **Basis**: Determined by **political**, **ethical**, and **budgetary considerations**, varying across countries and health systems.  
- **Example**: The UK’s **NICE** uses a threshold of **£20,000–£30,000 per QALY**, indicating the maximum cost deemed acceptable for an additional QALY.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, WTP thresholds guide decisions on whether interventions like new drugs or screening programs are worth funding, ensuring alignment with national health priorities.

### 🌍 GDP-Based Thresholds

**WHO-CHOICE Recommendations**:  
- **<1× GDP per capita per DALY averted**: **Highly cost-effective**, indicating excellent value for money.  
- **1–3× GDP per capita per DALY averted**: **Cost-effective**, acceptable but less compelling.  
- **For Malaysia**:  
  - **1× GDP per capita ≈ RM50,000**, leading to an **informal threshold** of **RM50,000–150,000 per QALY or DALY**.  
  - **Example**: An intervention with an ICER of RM40,000 per QALY is highly cost-effective, while one at RM80,000 is borderline.  
- **Caveat**: **GDP-based thresholds are criticized for being too simplistic and not context-sensitive**, as they may ignore **budget constraints** or **opportunity costs** specific to the health system.  

**Application**: In Malaysia, GDP-based thresholds provide a quick benchmark for evaluating interventions, but more nuanced approaches are often needed for precise decision-making.

### ⚖️ Opportunity Cost-Based Thresholds

**Approach**: Estimates thresholds based on the **marginal productivity of health spending**, i.e., the health gained per RM spent in the current system.  

- **Purpose**: **Reflects what must be forgone when resources are diverted to a new intervention.** This approach considers the health benefits lost from other programs when funding a new one, providing a more context-specific threshold.  
- **Importance**: Opportunity cost-based thresholds are increasingly favored for their ability to account for **real-world budget constraints**, ensuring that new interventions do not displace more valuable existing services.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, this approach helps ensure that resources allocated to new interventions, such as cancer drugs, do not compromise other critical services like primary care or vaccinations.

### 📊 Threshold Context in Malaysia

The table below summarizes **approximate threshold values** used in Malaysia for interpreting ICERs:

| **Threshold Type** | **Value (Approx.)** |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| **GDP per capita (1×)** | ~RM50,000 per QALY |
| **GDP per capita (3×)** | ~RM150,000 per QALY |
| **MoH/HTA Implied WTP (unofficial)** | RM90,000–120,000 per QALY |
| **Opportunity cost-based (estimated)** | ~RM30,000–50,000 per QALY |

- **Interpretation of RM80,000/QALY**:  
  - **Acceptable** for a **life-saving cancer drug with good QoL**, as it falls within or near the **MoH/HTA implied WTP** range (RM90,000–120,000), especially for high-priority conditions.  
  - **Less acceptable** for **low-impact interventions**, as it exceeds the **opportunity cost-based threshold** (RM30,000–50,000), indicating potential displacement of more valuable services.  
- **Application**: These thresholds guide decisions by Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health** or **MaHTAS**, ensuring that interventions align with budgetary and health priorities.

### 🩺 Mini Case Example: Colorectal Cancer Drug

**Scenario**: Malaysia is considering a **new drug for colorectal cancer** compared to **standard care**. The table below presents the data:

| **Option** | **Cost (RM)** | **QALYs Gained** |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Standard Care** | 20,000 | 1.5 |
| **New Drug** | 60,000 | 2.0 |

**ICER Calculation**:

$$ \text{ICER} = \frac{60,000 - 20,000}{2.0 - 1.5} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = 80,000 \, \text{RM per QALY} $$

**Interpretation**:  
- **WTP-based threshold (e.g., RM100,000/QALY)**: The new drug is **cost-effective**, as its ICER is below the threshold, suggesting good value for money.  
- **GDP-based threshold (RM50,000)**: The ICER is **borderline or not cost-effective**, as it exceeds the 1× GDP per capita benchmark, indicating caution in adoption.  
- **Opportunity cost estimate (RM30,000–40,000)**: The new drug is **not cost-effective**, as it exceeds the threshold, suggesting that funding it may displace more valuable interventions.  

**Practical Importance**: This case demonstrates how ICERs guide decisions in Malaysia’s health system. The choice of threshold—whether WTP, GDP-based, or opportunity cost-based—depends on the **context**, **budget constraints**, and **disease severity**, ensuring that decisions balance **efficiency**, **equity**, and **impact**.

## 🔍 8. Sensitivity Analysis

**Sensitivity analysis** is a critical component of economic evaluation, addressing the inherent uncertainties in data and assumptions. This section explores **why sensitivity analysis is needed**, the **types of sensitivity analysis**, their **application** in a breast cancer case, **visualization methods**, and the **purpose** of this technique. By testing how changes in parameters affect results, sensitivity analysis ensures that evaluations are **robust**, **transparent**, and **reliable**, supporting informed decision-making in resource-constrained health systems like Malaysia’s.

### ❓ Why Do We Need Sensitivity Analysis?

**Economic evaluations often rely on assumptions, estimates, and uncertain parameters** (e.g., cost data, utility values, treatment effects). **Real-world data are rarely perfect**, introducing uncertainty that can impact the reliability of conclusions. Sensitivity analysis addresses this by systematically testing how changes in these parameters affect the evaluation’s outcomes.

- **Purpose**: Answers **"How much would our conclusion change if the numbers change?"** This question ensures that decision-makers understand the robustness of results and the impact of uncertainty on policy recommendations.  
- **Importance**: Sensitivity analysis enhances the **credibility** of evaluations by identifying key drivers of cost-effectiveness and testing the stability of findings under varying conditions.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, sensitivity analysis is used by bodies like **MaHTAS** to ensure that Health Technology Assessments (HTAs) are reliable, especially when evaluating costly interventions like new cancer drugs.

### 📊 Types of Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis encompasses various methods to test uncertainty, each suited to different evaluation needs. The table below summarizes the **types of sensitivity analysis** with examples from a breast cancer case:

| **Type** | **Description** | **Example (Breast Cancer)** |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| **One-way (Univariate)** | Vary one parameter at a time | Vary drug cost from RM60,000 to RM40,000 |
| **Multi-way** | Vary two or more parameters simultaneously | Vary drug cost and utility score |
| **Scenario Analysis** | Test different plausible real-world scenarios | Assume public vs. private provision costs |
| **Probabilistic (PSA)** | Assign distributions to parameters; use Monte Carlo simulation | 1,000 simulations of cost, utility values |
| **Threshold Analysis** | Determine at what value the result changes | At what drug price is Drug A no longer cost-effective? |

- **One-way (Univariate) Analysis**:  
  - **Description**: Varies **one parameter at a time** while keeping others constant to assess its impact on results.  
  - **Example**: Varying the cost of Drug A from **RM60,000 to RM40,000** to see how it affects the ICER.  
  - **Use**: Simple and focused, ideal for identifying the impact of individual parameters.  
- **Multi-way Analysis**:  
  - **Description**: Varies **two or more parameters simultaneously** to explore combined effects.  
  - **Example**: Varying **drug cost** and **utility score** together to assess their joint impact on cost-effectiveness.  
  - **Use**: Captures interactions between parameters, providing a more comprehensive view of uncertainty.  
- **Scenario Analysis**:  
  - **Description**: Tests **different plausible real-world scenarios** to reflect alternative conditions.  
  - **Example**: Assuming **public vs. private provision costs** for Drug A to compare cost-effectiveness in different healthcare settings.  
  - **Use**: Useful for policy-relevant scenarios, such as different funding models in Malaysia.  
- **Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA)**:  
  - **Description**: Assigns **distributions to parameters** and uses **Monte Carlo simulation** to run thousands of scenarios, capturing overall uncertainty.  
  - **Example**: Running **1,000 simulations** of cost and utility values to estimate the probability of Drug A being cost-effective.  
  - **Use**: Provides a robust assessment of uncertainty, widely used in HTAs.  
- **Threshold Analysis**:  
  - **Description**: Determines **at what value a result changes**, such as when an intervention is no longer cost-effective.  
  - **Example**: Identifying the **maximum acceptable price** for Drug A to stay below a RM100,000/QALY threshold.  
  - **Use**: Helps set boundaries for decision-making, such as acceptable drug prices.

**Practical Importance**: These methods allow evaluators to test a range of uncertainties, ensuring that results are **robust** and **applicable** to real-world contexts like Malaysia’s public health system.

### 🩺 Example: Breast Cancer Drug A vs. B

This example applies sensitivity analysis to a breast cancer treatment evaluation, comparing **Drug A (targeted therapy)** versus **Drug B (standard chemotherapy)** with a **base ICER** of **RM80,000/QALY**:

- **One-way Analysis**:  
  - **If Drug A price drops to RM45,000 → ICER = RM50,000/QALY → Cost-effective.** A lower drug cost reduces the ICER, making Drug A more attractive compared to a threshold like RM100,000/QALY.  
  - **If utility value for Drug A is 0.7 instead of 0.8 → ICER increases → Less cost-effective.** A lower utility score reduces the health benefit, increasing the ICER and potentially making Drug A less viable.  
- **Threshold Analysis**:  
  - **What’s the maximum acceptable price for Drug A to stay below RM100,000/QALY?** This identifies the price point at which Drug A remains cost-effective, guiding pricing or reimbursement decisions.  

**Application**: This example shows how sensitivity analysis tests the **robustness** of the ICER, helping policymakers in Malaysia determine whether Drug A’s cost-effectiveness holds under varying conditions, such as price negotiations or changes in health outcomes.

### 📉 Visualizing Sensitivity Analysis

**Tornado Diagram**:  
- **Each horizontal bar represents how changing a specific input parameter affects the range of incremental costs.** For example, varying drug cost might produce a wide bar, indicating high impact.  
- **The wider the bar, the greater the influence of that parameter.** Parameters with larger impacts are prioritized in decision-making.  
- **Parameters are ordered from most to least influential.** This visual ranking helps identify **key drivers** of cost-effectiveness.  

**Importance**: Tornado diagrams provide a **clear visual representation** of uncertainty, making it easier for stakeholders like Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health** to understand which factors most affect an intervention’s value.

### 🎯 Purpose of Sensitivity Analysis

## 🧮 9. Economic Modeling

**Economic modeling** is a powerful tool in health economics, enabling evaluators to simulate complex clinical and economic processes when direct data are limited. This section explores **why economic models are used**, **when they are needed**, their **application** in a breast cancer case, the **types of models**, their **components**, **advantages**, and **limitations**. By understanding modeling, you will be equipped to assess **long-term outcomes** and **cost-effectiveness**, supporting **evidence-based** and **policy-relevant** decisions in contexts like Malaysia’s healthcare system.

### 🛠️ Why Use Economic Models?

**Economic models are simplified representations of real-world clinical and economic processes** used to address gaps in data and support decision-making. They provide a structured framework to simulate the impact of interventions over time and across scenarios.

- **Extrapolate outcomes beyond trial periods**: Models extend short-term trial data to predict long-term outcomes, such as survival or disease recurrence, which are critical for chronic conditions.  
- **Simulate long-term costs and effects**: They estimate costs and benefits over extended time horizons, capturing the full economic impact of interventions.  
- **Compare interventions where direct head-to-head studies are lacking**: Models allow comparisons when clinical trials do not directly compare alternatives, filling evidence gaps.  
- **Incorporate uncertainty in decision-making**: By testing various scenarios and assumptions, models account for data uncertainty, enhancing the robustness of evaluations.  
- **Importance**: Models are essential for **complex** or **long-term** health decisions, enabling policymakers in Malaysia to evaluate interventions like cancer treatments or vaccination programs when trial data are limited.  

### 📋 When is Modeling Needed?

Economic modeling is particularly valuable in scenarios where direct data are insufficient or decisions require long-term projections. The table below outlines key scenarios where modeling is essential:

| **Scenario** | **Modeling Role** |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Short-term trial data, long-term outcomes** | Project outcomes over time (e.g., survival) |
| **Multiple care pathways or disease stages** | Capture complexity (e.g., recurrence, remission) |
| **Rare diseases or low-event outcomes** | Simulate events not captured in trials |
| **Budget impact or scenario forecasting** | Compare national-scale impact |

- **Short-term trial data, long-term outcomes**: Models project outcomes like survival beyond the duration of clinical trials, critical for chronic diseases.  
- **Multiple care pathways or disease stages**: Models capture complex disease progression, such as cancer stages (e.g., remission, recurrence), which trials may not fully cover.  
- **Rare diseases or low-event outcomes**: Models simulate rare events (e.g., complications) that occur infrequently in trials, ensuring comprehensive evaluation.  
- **Budget impact or scenario forecasting**: Models assess the national-scale impact of interventions, such as the cost of rolling out a new drug across Malaysia’s health system.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, modeling is used by **MaHTAS** to evaluate interventions like cancer therapies, where long-term data or direct comparisons are often unavailable.

### 🩺 Example: Breast Cancer Case

**Context**: A trial compares **Drug A** vs. **Drug B** for HER2+ breast cancer with only **2-year follow-up data**.  
**Challenges**:  
- **Disease may recur after 5 years.** Short-term data miss long-term recurrence risks.  
- **Survival may extend beyond the trial.** Benefits like extended life expectancy are not fully captured.  
- **Costs change post-treatment** (e.g., monitoring, recurrence management). Ongoing costs are not reflected in trial data.  
**Modeling Benefits**:  
- **Estimates lifetime QALYs**: Models project **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** over the patient’s lifespan, capturing long-term health benefits.  
- **Estimates long-term costs**: Models account for costs like monitoring or recurrence treatment, providing a comprehensive economic picture.  
- **Estimates cost-effectiveness**: Models calculate the **cost-effectiveness** of Drug A vs. Drug B over the patient’s lifespan, guiding decisions for Malaysia’s health system.  

**Application**: This example shows how modeling bridges data gaps, enabling **MaHTAS** or the **Ministry of Health** to assess the long-term value of cancer treatments, ensuring informed resource allocation.

### 🧩 Basic Types of Economic Models

Economic models vary in complexity and application, with two primary types used in health economics: **Decision Trees** and **Markov Models**.

1. **Decision Tree**  
   - **Use**: Suitable for **short-term, one-time decisions**.  
   - **Structure**: **Branches represent choices and possible outcomes**, creating a tree-like diagram of decision points and consequences.  
   - **Characteristics**: **Simple and intuitive**, making it easy to visualize and understand.  
   - **Example**: Choosing between **Drug A and Drug B** for a **6-month adjuvant treatment course** in breast cancer, where outcomes like treatment success or failure are modeled.  
   - **Application**: Ideal for acute conditions or short-term interventions in Malaysia, such as evaluating surgical options.

2. **Markov Model**  
   - **Use**: Suitable for **chronic conditions or recurrent events**.  
   - **Structure**: **Patients transition between health states** (e.g., well, recurrence, dead), reflecting disease progression.  
   - **Time**: Divided into **cycles** (e.g., yearly), allowing for repeated transitions over time.  
   - **Example**: Modeling transitions in breast cancer: **Well → Local recurrence → Metastasis → Death**, capturing the dynamic nature of the disease.  
   - **Application**: Widely used in Malaysia for chronic diseases like cancer or diabetes, where long-term outcomes are critical.

### 🛠️ Key Components of a Markov Model

Markov models are particularly suited for chronic conditions, with the following key components:

- **States**: **Mutually exclusive** health states (e.g., stable, recurrence, death), representing distinct stages of a patient’s condition.  
- **Cycles**: **Time steps** (e.g., yearly), during which patients may transition between states.  
- **Transition Probabilities**: **Likelihood of moving between states**, based on clinical data or estimates (e.g., probability of cancer recurrence).  
- **Utilities and Costs**: **Assigned to each state per cycle**, capturing health benefits (e.g., QALYs) and costs (e.g., treatment costs) associated with each state.  

**Importance**: These components allow Markov models to simulate complex disease progression, making them essential for evaluating long-term interventions in Malaysia’s health system.

### 🌟 Advantages of Modeling

Economic models offer several benefits that enhance the quality of evaluations:

- **Captures long-term outcomes**: Models project outcomes like survival or quality of life beyond trial periods, critical for chronic diseases.  
- **Incorporates patient-level variability**: Models account for differences in patient outcomes, improving accuracy.  
- **Useful for scenario analysis and policy planning**: Models test various scenarios (e.g., different treatment uptake rates), supporting strategic decisions in Malaysia’s health policy.  

**Application**: Models enable **MaHTAS** to evaluate the long-term impact of interventions, ensuring that resources are allocated to high-value programs.

### ⚠️ Limitations

Despite their benefits, economic models have notable limitations:

- **Depends heavily on assumptions**: Models rely on estimated parameters (e.g., transition probabilities), which may introduce uncertainty.  
- **Quality of model = quality of inputs**: Inaccurate or incomplete data can compromise model reliability.  
- **Complex models can become opaque if not transparent**: Without clear documentation, complex models may be difficult to interpret, reducing trust in results.  

**Practical Importance**: In Malaysia, ensuring **transparent** and **high-quality inputs** is critical for models used in **HTA** processes, maintaining credibility and supporting evidence-based decisions.

## 🩺 10. Case Study: Comparing Drug A vs. Drug B for HER2+ Breast Cancer

This section presents a **case study** applying the principles of economic evaluation to compare **Drug A (new targeted therapy)** versus **Drug B (standard chemotherapy)** for women with early-stage **HER2+ breast cancer**. It covers the **scenario overview**, **input data and calculations**, and **interpretation of results**, illustrating how economic evaluation informs real-world health policy decisions. By integrating key concepts like perspective, time horizon, and the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), this case study demonstrates how to assess **cost-effectiveness** in Malaysia’s healthcare system, ensuring **evidence-based** and **policy-relevant** outcomes.

### 📋 Scenario Overview

The case study focuses on a practical health policy question relevant to Malaysia’s public health system, evaluating whether a new targeted therapy (Drug A) should be adopted over standard chemotherapy (Drug B) for HER2+ breast cancer.

- **Target Population**: **Women with early-stage HER2+ breast cancer**, a group requiring effective treatment to improve survival and quality of life.  
- **Perspective**: **Health system**, focusing on costs borne by healthcare providers, such as hospitals or the Ministry of Health, aligning with budget planning priorities.  
- **Time Horizon**: **5 years**, chosen to capture both short-term treatment costs and medium-term health outcomes, such as survival and recurrence prevention.  
- **Discount Rate**: **$3\%$ (applied but simplified for illustration)**, reflecting Malaysia’s standard rate for Health Technology Assessments (HTA) to adjust future costs and benefits to their present value.  

**Importance**: This scenario outlines the key parameters of the evaluation, ensuring that the analysis is **context-specific** and aligned with the needs of Malaysia’s health system, such as those addressed by **MaHTAS**.

### 📊 Input Data and Calculations

The evaluation compares **Drug A** and **Drug B** based on their costs and health outcomes, measured in **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**. The table below presents the input data:

| **Intervention** | **Cost (RM)** | **QALYs Gained** |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Drug B (Standard)** | 20,000 | 1.5 |
| **Drug A (New)** | 60,000 | 2.0 |

**Calculations**:  
- **Incremental Cost**: $\text{Cost}_A - \text{Cost}_B = 60,000 - 20,000 = 40,000 \, \text{RM}$  
  This represents the additional cost of adopting Drug A over Drug B.  
- **Incremental QALYs**: $2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5 \, \text{QALY}$  
  This indicates that Drug A provides an additional 0.5 QALYs compared to Drug B.  
- **ICER**:  
  $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = 80,000 \, \text{RM per QALY} $$  
  The ICER shows that adopting Drug A costs an additional **RM80,000 per QALY gained** compared to Drug B.  

**Practical Importance**: These calculations provide a **quantitative basis** for comparing Drug A and Drug B, enabling policymakers to assess whether the additional health benefits of Drug A justify its higher cost. In Malaysia, such calculations are critical for decisions about including new drugs in the **MyHEALTH formulary**.

### 🤔 Interpreting the Result

The **ICER** of **RM80,000 per QALY** must be compared to relevant thresholds to determine whether Drug A is cost-effective. The interpretation depends on the **threshold** used and the **context** of the decision:

- **If ICER threshold is RM100,000/QALY**: **Drug A is cost-effective.** The ICER of RM80,000 per QALY is below this threshold, suggesting that the additional cost is justified by the health benefits, making Drug A a viable option for adoption.  
- **If using 1× GDP threshold (~RM50,000/QALY)**: **Drug A is not cost-effective.** The ICER exceeds Malaysia’s informal GDP-based threshold, indicating that the additional cost may not be justified compared to other interventions.  
- **Final Decision Depends On**:  
  - **Budget constraints**: Limited health system budgets, as in Malaysia, may prioritize interventions with lower ICERs to maximize resource efficiency.  
  - **Severity of disease**: The life-threatening nature of HER2+ breast cancer may justify a higher ICER, especially if Drug A significantly improves survival or quality of life.  
  - **Equity considerations**: Ensuring access to effective treatments for underserved populations, such as through programs like **Peka B40**, may influence the decision to adopt Drug A despite its cost.  

**Application**: This interpretation guides Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health** or **MaHTAS** in deciding whether to fund Drug A, balancing **cost-effectiveness**, **clinical impact**, and **equity**. For example, a higher ICER might be acceptable for a life-saving cancer drug with significant quality-of-life benefits.

**Practical Importance**: The case study illustrates how **incremental analysis** and **ICER** provide a structured approach to evaluate health interventions. By comparing the ICER to context-specific thresholds, policymakers can make **evidence-based decisions** that align with Malaysia’s health priorities, ensuring **efficient** and **equitable** resource allocation.

## ⚠️ 11. Common Mistakes in Economic Evaluation

Conducting a robust economic evaluation is a complex process that demands **precision**, **transparency**, and **contextual relevance**. This section outlines **seven common mistakes** to avoid, providing insights into their **importance**, **potential pitfalls**, and **illustrative examples**. By understanding these errors, you will be better equipped to design and interpret evaluations that are **credible**, **reproducible**, and **policy-relevant**, ensuring effective decision-making in Malaysia’s healthcare system and beyond.

### 🚨 Overview

**Conducting a robust economic evaluation requires methodological clarity, transparent assumptions, and contextual relevance.** Errors in methodology or execution can undermine the validity of results, leading to misguided policy decisions. Below are **seven common mistakes** to avoid, each with significant implications for the quality and utility of economic evaluations:

### Mistake 1: Inappropriate or Unstated Perspective

- **Why It Matters**: **Perspective determines what costs and outcomes are included.** The choice of perspective (e.g., societal, health system, patient) shapes the scope of the analysis and ensures alignment with the decision-making context.  
- **Pitfall**: **Choosing a narrow perspective (e.g., provider only) when broader societal impact is relevant.** An inappropriate perspective can exclude critical costs or outcomes, leading to misleading conclusions. Similarly, failing to state the perspective reduces transparency and reproducibility.  
- **Example**: **Ignoring out-of-pocket costs in a study on cancer care for low-income populations.** A health system perspective might focus only on hospital costs, missing patient financial burdens, which are critical for equity-focused policies like Malaysia’s **Peka B40** program.  
- **Implication**: An inappropriate or unstated perspective can misalign the evaluation with stakeholder needs, such as those of **MaHTAS**, leading to decisions that overlook key impacts like patient affordability.

### Mistake 2: Incorrect or Inconsistent Costing

- **Why It Matters**: **Accurate costing is the foundation of economic evaluation.** Costs must reflect the true resource use to ensure credible comparisons between interventions.  
- **Pitfall**: **Using outdated prices, not adjusting for inflation, or mixing price sources.** Inconsistent costing methods (e.g., using private hospital rates for a public sector evaluation) can distort results, undermining the evaluation’s validity.  
- **Example**: **Drug costs based on private hospital rates in a public sector evaluation.** Using private sector prices (e.g., RM5,000 per drug cycle) instead of public sector tariffs (e.g., RM1,200) can inflate costs, leading to incorrect conclusions about cost-effectiveness.  
- **Implication**: In Malaysia, accurate costing is critical for **Ministry of Health** budget planning, and errors can lead to inefficient resource allocation or rejection of valuable interventions.

### Mistake 3: Inadequate Time Horizon

- **Why It Matters**: **Short horizons can miss long-term benefits or harms.** The time horizon must be long enough to capture all relevant costs and outcomes, especially for chronic or progressive conditions.  
- **Pitfall**: **Limiting analysis to trial duration for chronic or progressive conditions.** A short horizon may exclude significant long-term effects, biasing results against interventions with delayed benefits.  
- **Example**: **1-year horizon in breast cancer where recurrence risk continues for 10+ years.** A 1-year horizon captures only immediate drug costs, missing long-term benefits like reduced recurrence or extended survival, potentially deeming a valuable treatment not cost-effective.  
- **Implication**: In Malaysia, where chronic diseases like cancer are a priority, an inadequate time horizon can lead to underestimating the value of interventions, affecting **MaHTAS** evaluations.

### Mistake 4: No Discounting of Future Costs/Benefits

- **Why It Matters**: **Time preference must be accounted for in longer-term evaluations.** Future costs and benefits are worth less than immediate ones, requiring discounting to ensure fair comparisons.  
- **Pitfall**: **Ignoring discounting when the time horizon exceeds 1 year.** Failing to apply a discount rate overvalues future outcomes, distorting cost-effectiveness results.  
- **Example**: **Reporting lifelong QALYs without applying a discount rate.** Without discounting, a treatment yielding 0.8 QALYs over 5 years is overvalued compared to a discounted value (e.g., $\approx 0.76$ QALYs at $3\%$), leading to inaccurate conclusions.  
- **Implication**: In Malaysia, where **MaHTAS** uses a $3\%$ discount rate, omitting discounting can misguide decisions on long-term interventions like cancer therapies or vaccinations.

### Mistake 5: Missing or Weak Sensitivity Analysis

- **Why It Matters**: **Real-world data is uncertain, and robust decisions require uncertainty testing.** Sensitivity analysis ensures that results are reliable under varying assumptions.  
- **Pitfall**: **No sensitivity analysis or only testing trivial variables.** Failing to test key parameters or conducting superficial analyses reduces confidence in results.  
- **Example**: **Not testing variations in utility scores for high-impact side effects.** Ignoring how changes in quality-of-life scores (e.g., from 0.8 to 0.7) affect the ICER can overlook critical uncertainties in cancer treatment evaluations.  
- **Implication**: In Malaysia, robust sensitivity analysis is essential for **HTA** processes, ensuring that evaluations remain credible despite data uncertainties.

### Mistake 6: No Incremental Comparison or ICER Misuse

- **Why It Matters**: **ICER is core to decision-making.** The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) quantifies the additional cost per unit of health benefit, enabling fair comparisons.  
- **Pitfall**: **Reporting total cost and QALY without comparing alternatives.** Presenting only total values without an incremental analysis fails to show relative value.  
- **Example**: **"Drug A yields 2 QALYs at RM70,000" without comparing Drug B, making it unclear if it’s better.** Without an ICER, decision-makers cannot assess whether Drug A’s benefits justify its cost compared to Drug B.  
- **Implication**: In Malaysia, proper ICER use is critical for **MaHTAS** to compare interventions like new drugs, ensuring decisions are evidence-based.

### Mistake 7: Lack of Transparency or Reproducibility

- **Why It Matters**: **Policymakers and HTA agencies must understand assumptions.** Transparent reporting ensures that evaluations are credible and reproducible.  
- **Pitfall**: **No clear reporting of data sources, model assumptions, or analytic methods.** Opaque evaluations reduce trust and usability.  
- **Example**: **Using a Markov model without showing transition probabilities or utility weights.** Without documenting these inputs, stakeholders cannot verify the model’s validity, undermining its use in policy decisions.  
- **Implication**: In Malaysia, transparency is vital for **Ministry of Health** and **MaHTAS** evaluations, ensuring that results are trusted and actionable.

**Practical Importance**: Avoiding these mistakes ensures that economic evaluations are **robust**, **transparent**, and **aligned** with Malaysia’s health policy needs, such as those for **Universal Health Coverage** or **Peka B40**. By addressing these pitfalls, evaluators can produce **credible** results that support **efficient** and **equitable** resource allocation.

## 🏁 12. Conclusion

This concluding section synthesizes the key principles and practices of **economic evaluation**, emphasizing the importance of **methodological rigor**, **transparency**, and **contextual relevance** in achieving robust and actionable results. By highlighting the foundational elements of a good evaluation, it underscores how these principles enable **wise decision-making** to maximize health outcomes within the constraints of limited resources. This is particularly critical in Malaysia’s healthcare system, where evaluations guide policies to ensure **efficiency**, **equity**, and **sustainability**.

### 🎯 Key Principles for Robust Economic Evaluation

**Conducting a robust economic evaluation requires more than calculations—it demands methodological clarity, transparent assumptions, and contextual relevance.** A well-executed evaluation goes beyond mere number-crunching to provide **evidence-based insights** that support informed health policy decisions. The foundation of every good economic evaluation lies in:

- **Clear definition of the problem and perspective**:  
  - **Problem Definition**: Clearly stating the health issue or policy question (e.g., whether to adopt a new cancer drug) ensures the evaluation is focused and relevant.  
  - **Perspective**: Choosing the appropriate perspective (e.g., societal, health system, patient) determines which costs and outcomes are included, aligning the analysis with stakeholder needs, such as those of Malaysia’s **MaHTAS** or **Ministry of Health**.  
  - **Importance**: A well-defined problem and perspective ensure that the evaluation addresses the right question and captures the relevant impacts, avoiding misaligned or misleading conclusions.

- **Accurate costing and meaningful outcome measurement**:  
  - **Accurate Costing**: Systematically identifying, measuring, and valuing costs (e.g., direct medical, indirect, intangible) ensures that the financial burden of interventions is fully captured. For example, costing a new drug includes drug acquisition, monitoring, and side-effect management costs.  
  - **Meaningful Outcome Measurement**: Using appropriate outcomes (e.g., QALYs, life-years gained) ensures that the health benefits are relevant and measurable. In Malaysia, **QALYs** are often used in **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)** to assess quality of life impacts.  
  - **Importance**: Accurate and meaningful data provide a solid foundation for comparing interventions, ensuring **credibility** in evaluations.

- **Use of ICER and modeling to inform long-term decisions**:  
  - **ICER**: The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, calculated as  
    $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{New}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{Comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{New}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{Comparator}}} $$  
    quantifies the additional cost per unit of health benefit, guiding decisions on whether an intervention’s benefits justify its costs.  
  - **Modeling**: Tools like **decision trees** and **Markov models** simulate long-term costs and outcomes, bridging data gaps for chronic or complex conditions like cancer.  
  - **Importance**: These tools enable evaluations to capture **long-term impacts**, critical for Malaysia’s health system when assessing interventions like **vaccination programs** or **chronic disease treatments**.

- **Testing uncertainty through sensitivity analysis**:  
  - **Sensitivity Analysis**: Tests how changes in parameters (e.g., costs, utilities) affect results, using methods like **one-way**, **multi-way**, or **probabilistic analysis**. This ensures **robustness** and identifies key drivers of cost-effectiveness.  
  - **Importance**: By addressing uncertainty, sensitivity analysis enhances **confidence** in results, making evaluations reliable for policy decisions in Malaysia’s **HTA** processes.

**Practical Importance**: By adhering to these principles, economic evaluations can **support wise decisions** that maximize health outcomes within resource constraints. In Malaysia, this approach ensures that resources are allocated **efficiently** and **equitably**, supporting initiatives like **Universal Health Coverage** and **Peka B40** by prioritizing high-value interventions.

**Application**: These principles are critical for Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health** and **MaHTAS**, where evaluations guide decisions on adopting new drugs, scaling up programs, or allocating budgets. For example, evaluating a new cancer therapy requires a clear problem definition (e.g., improving survival), a health system perspective, accurate costing (e.g., drug and monitoring costs), meaningful outcomes (e.g., QALYs), ICER calculations, modeling for long-term effects, and sensitivity analysis to test uncertainties, ensuring a **robust** and **transparent** decision-making process.

The lecture underscores that **transparent reporting** is essential for bridging the gap between research and policy, ensuring evaluations are **trustworthy**, **reproducible**, and **actionable** for stakeholders such as Malaysia’s **MaHTAS** and **Ministry of Health**.

### 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of the lecture, students are able to:

- **Understand** the purpose and structure of the **CHEERS 2022 checklist**, recognizing its role in ensuring **clarity** and **completeness** in reporting.
- **Identify** the six domains of high-quality economic evaluation reporting, including Title & Abstract, Methods, and Results.
- **Apply** CHEERS to appraise published studies, systematically evaluating reporting quality using a practical coding system (✅, 🟡, ❌).
- **Recognize** common reporting gaps (e.g., missing perspective, incomplete model details) and their implications for **policy relevance**.

### 🔍 Recap of Foundational Concepts

The lecture begins with a recap of **Economic Evaluation II**, outlining the systematic steps for conducting economic evaluations:

- **Define problem and comparators**, **choose perspective**, **identify, measure, and value costs and outcomes**, **apply discounting**, **calculate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, and **perform sensitivity analysis** and **modeling**.
- **Costing** includes **direct medical** (e.g., hospital stays), **direct non-medical** (e.g., travel), **indirect** (e.g., productivity losses), and **intangible** (e.g., pain) costs, with methods like **micro-costing** and **gross costing**.
- **Outcome measurement** involves **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)** (natural units, e.g., life-years), **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)** (e.g., **QALYs**, **DALYs**), and **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)** (monetized outcomes).
- **ICER** is calculated as:  
    $$\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Incremental Cost}}{\text{Incremental QALYs}}$$  
    and compared to thresholds (e.g., willingness-to-pay, GDP per capita).
- **Sensitivity analysis** (one-way, multi-way, probabilistic) tests robustness, while **economic modeling** (e.g., **decision trees**, **Markov models**) simulates long-term or complex outcomes.

**Key Takeaway**: **“Even the most precise analysis is only as useful as its clarity; economic evaluation must be methodologically sound and transparently reported.”**

### ❓ Importance of Critical Appraisal

Critical appraisal ensures that economic evaluations are **credible** and **policy-relevant**:

- **Problem**: Many studies appear robust with **advanced modeling** and **impressive ICERs** but lack credibility due to **poor reporting**.
- **Consequences of Poor Reporting**:
    - Cannot be **replicated** or **adapted** to contexts like Malaysia.
    - May **mislead policy decisions**, leading to **low trust** and **limited impact**.
- **Benefits of Well-Reported Studies**:
    - Support **justifiable reimbursement** (e.g., Peka B40), **efficient resource allocation** (e.g., cancer screening vs. ICU beds), and **HTA inclusion** (e.g., MaHTAS reviews).
- **Key Message**: **“A strong economic evaluation is not just about having the right model, it’s about reporting it clearly, so others can evaluate and trust your results.”**

### 📋 Understanding CHEERS 2022

The **CHEERS 2022 checklist**, developed by **ISPOR**, standardizes reporting to enhance **clarity** and **completeness**:

- **First Released**: 2013, updated in 2022.
- **Purpose**: Improve reporting, not judge study quality.
- **What It Is/Isn’t**:
    
|**CHEERS IS**|**CHEERS IS NOT**|
|---|---|
|A reporting checklist|A quality scoring tool|
|A guide for authors, reviewers, policy users|A tool for determining “good” vs. “bad” studies|
|Applicable to all economic evaluations|A substitute for peer review|
    
- **Why It Matters**: Addresses **incomplete or inconsistent reporting**, meeting stakeholder needs for **transparent methods**, **clear assumptions**, and **reproducible results**.
- **Example**: A study claiming “QALYs were estimated” without specifying the utility tool, preferences, or time horizon renders the ICER **uninterpretable**.
- **Policy Use**: Adopted by **HTA agencies** (e.g., NICE, MaHTAS), **journals**, and **researchers** to support **evidence transparency**.

**Key Takeaway**: **“If it’s not reported, it didn’t happen. CHEERS ensures every essential part of an economic evaluation is visible, understandable, and usable.”**

### 🧩 CHEERS 2022 Structure

The CHEERS 2022 checklist includes **28 items** across **6 domains**:

|**Domain**|**Purpose**|**Key Examples**|
|---|---|---|
|Title & Abstract|Identify as economic evaluation, summarize findings|Label study type, summarize ICER|
|Introduction|Explain research question and policy relevance|State objective, context|
|Methods|Describe how evaluation was conducted|Perspective, time horizon, modeling|
|Results|Present outcomes clearly|ICER, uncertainty, subgroups|
|Discussion|Reflect on limitations and implications|Generalizability, equity|
|Other Information|Promote transparency, reproducibility|Funding, conflicts of interest|

**Key Message**: **“Each domain tells part of the story. CHEERS doesn’t ask if your results are correct, only if readers can understand what you did, why, and how.”**

### 🔬 Focus on the Methods Section

The **methods section** is the **engine room** of an economic evaluation, covering **18 CHEERS items** (4–21) like perspective, costing, and modeling:

- **Why Critical**: Determines if findings are **understandable**, **reproducible**, and **policy-relevant**.
- **Example Gaps**:
    
|**CHEERS Item**|**Strong Reporting**|**Weak Reporting**|
|---|---|---|
|Perspective|“Health system perspective, per MaHTAS guidelines”|“Costs were included”|
|Discount Rate|“3% annually, per HTA norms”|“Discounting applied”|
|Sensitivity Analysis|“One-way and probabilistic analyses on costs, utilities”|“Sensitivity analysis done”|
    
- **Critical Question**: **“Could a policymaker or researcher reproduce this study based on the methods reported?”**

### 🛠️ Applying CHEERS in Practice

Applying CHEERS involves:

1. **Read section by section** (Title/Abstract → Discussion).
2. **Match sections to CHEERS items**.
3. **Evaluate** using a coding system:
    
|**Symbol**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|
|✅|Clearly reported|
|🟡|Unclear/incomplete|
|❌|Not reported|
    

This systematic approach ensures **transparent** and **objective** appraisal, critical for policy contexts like Malaysia.

### 📖 Case Study: Appraising a Published Study

The lecture appraises a study by Hofer et al. (2018) on lung cancer screening:

- **Title**: _Cost-utility analysis of a potential lung cancer screening program for a high-risk population in Germany: A modelling approach_
- **Objective**: Evaluate cost-effectiveness from a **public payer perspective** for heavy smokers (aged 55–75).
- **Methods**: Two **Markov models**, 60 cycles (3-month length), outcomes (costs, life years, QALYs), deterministic/probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
- **Results**: Incremental costs (€1,153/person), gains (0.06 life years, 0.04 QALYs), ICER (€19,302/LY, €30,291/QALY).
- **Appraisal**: 17 items ✅ (e.g., perspective, results), 4 🟡 (e.g., QALY valuation), 7 ❌ (e.g., subgroup heterogeneity, stakeholder engagement).

The appraisal highlights **strong reporting** in most areas but gaps in equity and stakeholder engagement, limiting full **policy applicability**.

### 🚨 Common Reporting Gaps

The **top five reporting gaps** include:

1. **Perspective Not Stated**: Misleads on cost/outcome scope (e.g., drug costs claimed as societal).
2. **No Justification for Time Horizon/Discount Rate**: Undermines long-term credibility (e.g., lifetime model without discounting).
3. **Omission of Sensitivity Analysis**: Limits uncertainty assessment (e.g., ICER without robustness testing).
4. **Incomplete Model Structure**: Hinders replication (e.g., Markov model without state details).
5. **Utility Sources Not Reported**: Affects QALY reliability (e.g., “literature weights” without citation).

These gaps reduce **trust**, **reproducibility**, and **policy uptake**, emphasizing the need for CHEERS compliance.

### 🌍 Policy Impact of Transparent Reporting

**Transparent reporting** enhances policy impact by:

- Supporting **HTAs**, **budget allocation**, **reimbursement** (e.g., Peka B40), and **guidelines**.
- **Local Relevance**: MaHTAS, HITAP, and NICE require CHEERS compliance for **MyHTA reports**, **pharmacoeconomic documents**, and **regional dialogues**.
- **Key Insight**: **“Health systems don’t make million-ringgit decisions on vague data. CHEERS bridges the gap between research and policy.”**

### 🗝️ Final Takeaways

- **CHEERS 2022** enhances **clarity**, **transparency**, and **policy usability**.
- **Appraisal** assesses **communication clarity**, complementing peer review.
- **Gaps** (e.g., missing perspective) reduce trust and applicability.
- **Transparent reporting** builds **trust** and **policy uptake**, critical for Malaysia’s healthcare system.

## 🔍 2. Recap of Economic Evaluation II

This section provides a comprehensive review of the foundational concepts covered in **Economic Evaluation II**, setting the stage for understanding the critical appraisal process in **Economic Evaluation III**. It outlines the systematic steps for conducting a full economic evaluation, details the types and methods of costing, explains outcome measurement approaches, introduces the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), and explores sensitivity analysis and economic modeling. These concepts are crucial for assessing the **transparency** and **clarity** of economic evaluations using the **CHEERS 2022 checklist**, as they form the methodological backbone that must be clearly reported for policy relevance. The recap emphasizes the importance of **methodological rigor** and **transparent reporting** to ensure evaluations are robust and usable in health policy decisions, such as those by Malaysia’s **MaHTAS** or other Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies.

### Steps in Conducting a Full Economic Evaluation

A **systematic approach** is essential for conducting robust and policy-relevant economic evaluations. These evaluations provide a structured framework to compare health interventions, ensuring that limited resources are allocated efficiently to maximize health outcomes. The key steps are:

- **Define the problem and comparators**: Clearly articulate the health issue and identify the interventions to be compared (e.g., a new drug vs. standard care). This step ensures the evaluation addresses a specific, relevant question.
- **Choose the perspective**: Select the viewpoint (e.g., **societal**, **health system**) that determines which costs and outcomes are included. For example, a societal perspective includes all costs, while a health system perspective focuses on direct medical costs.
- **Identify, measure, and value costs and outcomes**: Systematically account for all relevant costs (e.g., medical, non-medical) and outcomes (e.g., life-years, QALYs), quantifying them accurately to enable fair comparisons.
- **Apply discounting and set a relevant time horizon**: Adjust future costs and outcomes using a discount rate (e.g., 3%) to reflect their present value, and choose an appropriate time frame (e.g., lifetime for chronic diseases) to capture all relevant effects.
- **Calculate and interpret the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**: Compute the ICER to compare the additional costs and benefits of one intervention over another, interpreting it against thresholds like willingness-to-pay or GDP per capita.
- **Perform sensitivity analysis and, when needed, economic modeling**: Test the robustness of results by varying key parameters and use models (e.g., Markov models) to simulate long-term or complex outcomes.

These steps ensure that economic evaluations are **comprehensive**, **transparent**, and **aligned** with policy needs, providing decision-makers with reliable evidence to prioritize interventions.

### Costing in Economic Evaluations

Costing is a critical component of economic evaluations, as it quantifies the resources consumed by an intervention. Accurate costing ensures that evaluations reflect the true economic burden and enable fair comparisons between alternatives.

- **Types of Costs**:
    - **Direct Medical**: Costs directly related to healthcare delivery, such as **hospital stays** (e.g., ward costs, surgical procedures) and **medications** (e.g., drug prescriptions).
    - **Direct Non-Medical**: Costs incurred outside healthcare but related to accessing it, such as **travel** (e.g., transportation to clinics) and **caregiving** (e.g., time spent by family members).
    - **Indirect**: Economic impacts beyond direct expenses, such as **productivity losses** (e.g., lost wages due to illness or treatment).
    - **Intangible**: Non-financial costs that are difficult to quantify, such as **pain** or **suffering** experienced by patients, often considered qualitatively.
- **Costing Methods**:
    - **Micro-costing**: A detailed approach that identifies and measures each resource unit (e.g., cost per hospital bed-day, per consultation), providing high precision but requiring extensive data.
    - **Gross costing**: An aggregated approach that uses average or total costs (e.g., cost per patient episode), which is simpler but less detailed.
- **Perspective**: The chosen perspective determines which costs are included. For example:
    - A **societal perspective** includes all costs (medical, non-medical, indirect, and sometimes intangible).
    - A **health system perspective** focuses solely on direct medical costs, relevant for bodies like Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health (MOH)**.

Proper costing ensures that evaluations capture the full economic impact of interventions, aligning with the decision-maker’s perspective and context.

### Outcome Measurement

Measuring outcomes is essential for assessing the **health benefits** of interventions. Different types of economic evaluations use distinct outcome measures, each suited to specific decision-making needs.

- **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**: Measures outcomes in **natural units**, such as:
    - **Life-years gained**: Extending survival through treatments like heart surgery.
    - **Cases prevented**: Reducing disease incidence through interventions like vaccinations.
- **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)**: Uses **utility-based measures** that account for both quantity and quality of life, such as:
    - **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**: Combines life expectancy with quality of life, where 1 QALY represents one year in perfect health.
    - **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)**: Quantifies disease burden by measuring years lost due to disability or premature death.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**: **Monetizes outcomes**, converting health benefits into monetary values (e.g., the financial value of productivity gains from a health program).
- **Utility Values**: Essential for QALY calculations, these are often derived from standardized tools like **EQ-5D**, which measures health-related quality of life across dimensions like mobility and pain. These values reflect patient or population preferences, ensuring outcomes are meaningful.

Selecting the appropriate outcome measure ensures that evaluations capture the most relevant health impacts, facilitating comparisons across interventions.

### ICER and Thresholds

The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** is a key metric in economic evaluations, quantifying the additional cost per unit of additional health benefit when comparing two interventions.

- **Calculation**:  
    $$\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Incremental Cost}}{\text{Incremental QALYs}}$$
    
    - **Incremental Cost**: The difference in costs between the intervention and its comparator (e.g., new treatment vs. standard care).
    - **Incremental QALYs**: The difference in QALYs gained between the two options.
    - **Example**: If a new drug costs an additional RM50,000 and provides 0.5 extra QALYs compared to standard care, the ICER is:  
        $$\text{ICER} = \frac{50000}{0.5} = 100000 , \text{RM per QALY}$$
- **Interpretation**: The ICER is compared to **thresholds** to determine cost-effectiveness:
    
    - **Willingness-to-pay (WTP)**: The maximum amount a decision-maker is willing to pay for an additional unit of outcome (e.g., RM100,000 per QALY).
    - **GDP per capita**: Often used as a benchmark (e.g., 1–3 times GDP per capita in Malaysia for cost-effectiveness).
    - If the ICER is below the threshold, the intervention is considered cost-effective.
- **Influences**: The ICER is sensitive to:
    
    - **Time horizon**: A longer horizon (e.g., lifetime) may capture more benefits, lowering the ICER.
    - **Discounting**: Applying a discount rate (e.g., 3%) reduces the value of future costs and outcomes, affecting the ICER.

The ICER provides a standardized measure to guide resource allocation decisions, ensuring that interventions deliver value for money.

### Sensitivity Analysis

**Sensitivity analysis** tests the **robustness** of economic evaluation results by examining how changes in key parameters affect conclusions. It is critical for addressing uncertainty and ensuring that findings are reliable for policy decisions.

- **Types**:
    - **One-way**: Varies one parameter at a time (e.g., drug cost) to assess its impact on the ICER, identifying key drivers of results.
    - **Multi-way**: Varies multiple parameters simultaneously to explore combined effects, providing a broader view of uncertainty.
    - **Probabilistic**: Uses probability distributions for parameters (e.g., costs, utilities) to simulate a range of outcomes, often presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
- **Purpose**:
    - **Tests robustness**: Determines whether conclusions hold under different assumptions or data inputs.
    - **Identifies uncertainty**: Highlights parameters with the greatest impact on results, guiding further research or data collection.
    - **Example**: In a cancer treatment evaluation, sensitivity analysis might show that the ICER is highly sensitive to drug cost but robust to changes in utility values.

Sensitivity analysis ensures that evaluations are **transparent** about uncertainty, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions with confidence.

### Economic Modelling

**Economic modeling** is used when direct data are insufficient to capture long-term or complex outcomes, allowing analysts to simulate the impacts of interventions over time or across scenarios.

- **When Used**: Models are necessary for:
    - **Long-term outcomes**: When benefits (e.g., survival gains) extend beyond trial data (e.g., 10-year impacts of a cancer drug).
    - **Complex pathways**: When interventions involve multiple health states or transitions (e.g., chronic diseases with remission and relapse).
- **Types**:
    - **Decision Trees**: Suitable for **short-term outcomes**, modeling discrete choices and outcomes (e.g., surgical vs. non-surgical treatment for appendicitis).
    - **Markov Models**: Ideal for **chronic or recurrent conditions**, simulating transitions between health states over time (e.g., cancer progression with remission, relapse, and death states).
- **Example**: A Markov model for a diabetes intervention might simulate transitions between “healthy,” “complications,” and “death” states to estimate long-term costs and QALYs.

Economic modeling enhances the flexibility and applicability of evaluations, enabling decision-makers to assess interventions in scenarios where empirical data are limited.

### 🗝️ Key Takeaway

> **“Even the most precise analysis is only as useful as its clarity; economic evaluation must be methodologically sound and transparently reported.”**

This underscores the dual importance of **methodological rigor** and **transparent reporting**. A technically accurate evaluation is ineffective if its methods, assumptions, and results are not clearly communicated to stakeholders like policymakers or HTA agencies (e.g., MaHTAS). Transparent reporting ensures that evaluations are **reproducible**, **trustworthy**, and **usable** for informing health policy decisions, bridging the gap between research and real-world impact.

## ❓ 3. Why Critical Appraisal Matters

This section explores the critical importance of appraising economic evaluations to ensure their **credibility** and **utility** in health policy decision-making. While many economic evaluations appear robust, with sophisticated statistical methods and impressive results, their value hinges on **transparent reporting**. Without clear and complete reporting, even the most methodologically sound studies can lack credibility, limiting their impact on public health policy. Critical appraisal, guided by tools like the **CHEERS 2022 checklist**, enables stakeholders to assess whether evaluations are **reproducible**, **adaptable**, and **trustworthy**, particularly in contexts like Malaysia’s health system. By understanding the consequences of poor reporting and the benefits of well-reported studies, students will appreciate the role of critical appraisal in supporting **evidence-based**, **efficient**, and **equitable** resource allocation.

### The Problem with Economic Evaluations

Many economic evaluations appear robust but lack credibility due to poor reporting, undermining their ability to inform policy decisions effectively.

- **Look statistically rigorous** and use **advanced modeling**: Evaluations often employ complex statistical techniques or sophisticated models, such as Markov models, to simulate long-term outcomes, giving the impression of high quality.
- **Show impressive ICERs**: Results, such as low Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs), may suggest cost-effectiveness, making the intervention appear highly valuable.
- **Problem**: **If key details aren’t reported, we can’t assess their credibility.** Without clear documentation of methods, assumptions, or data sources, stakeholders cannot verify the validity of the results, rendering even the most precise analysis unreliable.

This issue highlights the need for critical appraisal to scrutinize the **transparency** and **completeness** of economic evaluations, ensuring they meet the standards required for policy relevance.

### Consequences of Poor Reporting

Poorly reported evaluations have significant drawbacks that limit their utility and impact in health policy and practice.

- **Cannot be replicated**: Without detailed reporting of methods (e.g., data sources, model structure), other researchers or policymakers cannot reproduce the study to confirm its findings.
- **Cannot be adapted to other contexts (e.g., Malaysia)**: Incomplete reporting prevents the application of results to different settings, such as adapting a study conducted in a high-income country to Malaysia’s resource-constrained health system.
- **May mislead policy decisions**: Vague or incomplete information can lead to incorrect conclusions, potentially resulting in inefficient or inequitable resource allocation.
- **Lack transparency**, leading to **low trust** and **limited impact**: Stakeholders, such as Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health** or **MaHTAS**, are less likely to trust or act on studies that lack clear reporting, reducing their influence on policy.

These consequences underscore the critical need for transparent reporting to ensure evaluations are **trustworthy** and **actionable** for decision-makers.

### Importance for Public Health and Policy

Well-reported studies, appraised using tools like CHEERS 2022, enable robust and informed decision-making in public health, supporting efficient and equitable resource allocation.

- **Justifiable reimbursement decisions**: Clear reporting allows policymakers to make evidence-based decisions about funding interventions, such as including treatments in Malaysia’s **Peka B40** program, which provides healthcare support for low-income groups.
- **Efficient resource allocation**: Transparent evaluations help prioritize interventions that maximize health outcomes within budget constraints, such as deciding whether to invest in **cancer screening** programs or additional **ICU beds**.
- **Inclusion in Health Technology Assessments (HTAs)**: Well-reported studies are more likely to meet the rigorous standards of HTA bodies like **MaHTAS** (Malaysia Health Technology Assessment Section), ensuring they inform national health policies and guidelines.

By providing **clarity** and **transparency**, well-reported evaluations strengthen the evidence base for health policy, enhancing trust and uptake among decision-makers.

### 🗝️ Key Message

> **“A strong economic evaluation is not just about having the right model, it’s about reporting it clearly, so others can evaluate and trust your results.”**

This emphasizes that the value of an economic evaluation lies not only in its methodological rigor but also in its ability to communicate findings clearly. Transparent reporting ensures that stakeholders, such as policymakers, researchers, and HTA agencies, can **evaluate**, **trust**, and **apply** the results to make informed decisions that optimize health outcomes within limited resources.

## 📋 4. Understanding CHEERS 2022

The **Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022** is a critical framework for ensuring **clarity** and **completeness** in the reporting of economic evaluations. Developed by the **International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR)**, CHEERS 2022 provides a standardized checklist to enhance the **transparency** and **usability** of economic evaluations, making them accessible to decision-makers, researchers, and health technology assessment (HTA) agencies. By understanding what CHEERS is, its purpose, and its role in policy and research, students will gain the tools to critically appraise studies, ensuring they meet the rigorous reporting standards needed to inform **evidence-based health policy** decisions in contexts like Malaysia’s healthcare system. This section sets the foundation for applying CHEERS to evaluate the quality of reporting in published studies, a key skill for public health professionals.

### What is CHEERS?

**CHEERS** (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) is a reporting framework developed by the **International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR)** to standardize and improve the reporting of economic evaluations in healthcare.

- **First Released**: 2013, establishing an initial set of guidelines to promote consistent reporting.
- **Updated**: 2022, incorporating advancements in health economics and feedback from stakeholders to enhance clarity and applicability.
- **Purpose**: Improve **reporting clarity and completeness**, not to judge study quality. CHEERS ensures that all essential components of an economic evaluation are clearly documented, enabling stakeholders to understand and trust the findings without assessing their methodological validity.

CHEERS serves as a vital tool for authors, reviewers, and policymakers, ensuring that economic evaluations are **transparent**, **reproducible**, and **policy-relevant**, particularly for HTA bodies like Malaysia’s **MaHTAS**.

### CHEERS: What It Is and Isn’t

To clarify its role, CHEERS is distinguished by what it is designed to achieve and what it does not do. The following table summarizes its scope:

|**CHEERS IS**|**CHEERS IS NOT**|
|---|---|
|A reporting checklist|A quality scoring tool|
|A guide for authors, reviewers, and policy users|A tool for determining “good” vs. “bad” studies|
|Applicable to all types of economic evaluation|A substitute for technical peer review|

- **A reporting checklist**: CHEERS provides a structured list of items to ensure all critical aspects of an economic evaluation (e.g., methods, results, assumptions) are reported clearly.
- **A guide for authors, reviewers, and policy users**: It assists researchers in preparing manuscripts, reviewers in evaluating submissions, and policymakers in interpreting findings for decision-making.
- **Applicable to all types of economic evaluation**: CHEERS is versatile, covering cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), cost-utility analysis (CUA), cost-benefit analysis (CBA), and cost-minimization analysis (CMA).
- **Not a quality scoring tool**: CHEERS focuses on reporting transparency, not on assessing the methodological rigor or validity of the study’s results.
- **Not a tool for determining “good” vs. “bad” studies**: It evaluates whether a study is clearly reported, not whether its conclusions are correct.
- **Not a substitute for technical peer review**: CHEERS complements, but does not replace, detailed methodological scrutiny by experts.

> **“CHEERS tells you if the study was clearly and completely reported—not whether the results are valid.”**

This distinction ensures that CHEERS is used appropriately as a **reporting standard**, guiding stakeholders to focus on transparency rather than substituting for in-depth technical evaluation.

### Why CHEERS Matters

The importance of CHEERS lies in addressing the pervasive issue of **incomplete or inconsistent reporting** in economic evaluations, which undermines their utility for decision-making.

- **Issue**: Reporting in economic evaluations is often **incomplete or inconsistent**, making it difficult for stakeholders to understand or trust the findings.
- **Needs of Stakeholders**:
    - **Decision-makers**, **HTA agencies** (e.g., **NICE** in the UK, **MaHTAS** in Malaysia), and **journals** require:
        - **Transparent methods**: Clear documentation of how the study was conducted, including data sources and analytical approaches.
        - **Clear assumptions**: Explicit reporting of assumptions (e.g., discount rates, utility values) to enable scrutiny.
        - **Reproducible results**: Sufficient detail to allow other researchers or policymakers to replicate or adapt the study.
- **Example**: A study claims “QALYs were estimated” but omits critical details:
    - Which **utility tool** was used (e.g., EQ-5D, SF-6D)?
    - **Whose preferences** were considered (e.g., patient or population-based)?
    - **Time horizon** or **discounting details** (e.g., 3% discount rate, lifetime horizon)?
    - **Impact**: Without these details, even a correct Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is **uninterpretable**, as stakeholders cannot assess its validity or relevance.

Incomplete reporting reduces the credibility of evaluations, limiting their ability to inform **evidence-based decisions** in health policy and practice.

### CHEERS in Policy and Research

CHEERS 2022 is widely adopted across various domains, reinforcing its role in promoting **evidence transparency** in health system decision-making.

- **Used By**:
    - **HTA Agencies**: Organizations like **NICE** (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK) and **MaHTAS** (Malaysia Health Technology Assessment Section) rely on CHEERS-compliant reporting to evaluate interventions for inclusion in health systems or national guidelines.
    - **Peer-Reviewed Journals**: Leading journals require CHEERS compliance to ensure published studies are transparent and reproducible, enhancing their scientific integrity.
    - **Researchers** preparing manuscripts: CHEERS guides researchers in structuring their reports to meet the expectations of journals and policymakers.
- **Alignment**: CHEERS supports the growing emphasis on **evidence transparency** in health system decision-making, ensuring that economic evaluations are accessible, understandable, and actionable for stakeholders like Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health**.

By standardizing reporting, CHEERS bridges the gap between research and policy, enabling evaluations to inform critical decisions such as **reimbursement**, **resource allocation**, and **national health priorities**.

### 🗝️ Key Takeaway

> **“If it’s not reported, it didn’t happen. CHEERS ensures every essential part of an economic evaluation is visible, understandable, and usable.”**

This underscores the critical role of CHEERS in making economic evaluations **visible**, **understandable**, and **usable** for stakeholders. By ensuring that every essential component—such as methods, assumptions, and results—is clearly reported, CHEERS enhances the **trustworthiness** and **policy relevance** of evaluations, enabling informed decision-making in resource-constrained settings like Malaysia’s healthcare system.

## 🔬 6. Focus on the Methods Section

This section delves into the critical importance of the **methods section** in economic evaluations, emphasizing its role as the **core component** that determines the **transparency**, **reproducibility**, and **policy relevance** of a study. The **Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 checklist** dedicates **18 items** (items 4–21) to the methods section, covering essential aspects such as perspective, costing, modeling, and stakeholder engagement. By providing detailed and clear reporting of these elements, the methods section ensures that findings are **understandable** to stakeholders like policymakers and **reproducible** by researchers, enabling informed decision-making in contexts such as Malaysia’s health system. This section also presents examples of strong and weak reporting practices and poses a critical question to guide appraisal, equipping students with the skills to evaluate the quality of reporting in economic evaluations using CHEERS 2022.

### Why Focus on Methods?

The **methods section** is the **engine room** of an economic evaluation, serving as the foundation for its credibility and utility in health policy.

- The **methods section** is the **engine room** of an economic evaluation: It contains the technical details that underpin the study’s findings, making it the most critical component for assessing the validity and applicability of results.
- It determines whether findings are **understandable**, **reproducible**, and **policy-relevant**: Clear reporting ensures that policymakers (e.g., Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health** or **MaHTAS**) can comprehend the study’s approach, researchers can replicate it, and decision-makers can apply it to real-world contexts.
- CHEERS includes **18 items** under Methods (items 4–21), covering aspects like perspective, costing, modeling, and stakeholder engagement: These items address critical elements such as the study’s perspective, time horizon, data sources, and analytical methods, ensuring comprehensive documentation.

A well-reported methods section is essential for bridging the gap between research and policy, enabling stakeholders to trust and act on the findings of economic evaluations.

### Example CHEERS Items from the Methods Section

To illustrate the importance of transparent reporting, the table below compares **strong** and **weak/incomplete** reporting examples for key CHEERS items in the methods section. These examples highlight how detailed reporting enhances clarity and reproducibility, while vague reporting undermines the study’s utility.

|**CHEERS Item**|**Strong Reporting Example**|**Weak/Incomplete Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Perspective (Item 8)**|“A health system perspective was adopted, including only direct medical costs as per MaHTAS guidelines.”|“Costs were included.”|
|**Time Horizon (Item 9)**|“Lifetime horizon was used to reflect long-term recurrence and survival.”|“Analysis was done for a few years.”|
|**Discount Rate (Item 10)**|“Both costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually, consistent with HTA norms.”|“Discounting was applied.”|
|**Health Outcomes (Item 11)**|“QALYs were estimated using EQ-5D-5L with Malaysian value set.”|“QALYs were used.”|
|**Costing Approach (Item 14)**|“Resource use was obtained from clinical records and unit costs were sourced from MOH tariffs.”|“Costs were estimated.”|
|**Modelling Approach (Item 16)**|“A Markov model with 1-year cycles simulated transitions between remission, relapse, and death.”|“A model was used to project results.”|
|**Sensitivity Analysis (Item 20)**|“One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted on drug cost, utilities, and transition probabilities.”|“Sensitivity analysis was done.”|

- **Perspective (Item 8)**: Strong reporting specifies the perspective (e.g., health system) and aligns it with guidelines (e.g., MaHTAS), while weak reporting vaguely mentions costs without context.
- **Time Horizon (Item 9)**: Strong reporting justifies a lifetime horizon for capturing long-term outcomes, whereas weak reporting provides an ambiguous timeframe.
- **Discount Rate (Item 10)**: Strong reporting details the discount rate (e.g., 3%) and its alignment with HTA standards, while weak reporting fails to specify the rate or rationale.
- **Health Outcomes (Item 11)**: Strong reporting identifies the tool (e.g., EQ-5D-5L) and value set (e.g., Malaysian), ensuring clarity, while weak reporting is vague about QALY estimation.
- **Costing Approach (Item 14)**: Strong reporting details data sources (e.g., clinical records, MOH tariffs), enabling verification, while weak reporting lacks specificity.
- **Modelling Approach (Item 16)**: Strong reporting describes the model structure (e.g., Markov model with 1-year cycles) and states, while weak reporting omits details.
- **Sensitivity Analysis (Item 20)**: Strong reporting specifies the types (e.g., one-way, probabilistic) and parameters tested, while weak reporting is non-specific.

These examples demonstrate that **strong reporting** provides the detail needed for **transparency** and **reproducibility**, while **weak reporting** leaves stakeholders unable to assess or trust the findings.

### Critical Question

> **Could a policymaker or another researcher reproduce this study based on what’s reported in the methods section?**

This underscores the importance of the methods section in enabling **reproducibility**. A well-reported methods section should provide sufficient detail for policymakers to understand the study’s approach and for researchers to replicate it in other contexts. If key details—such as data sources, model structure, or analytical methods—are missing or unclear, the study’s findings cannot be verified or applied, reducing its **policy impact**. This question serves as a guiding principle for appraising economic evaluations using the CHEERS 2022 checklist, ensuring that the methods section meets the standards of **clarity** and **completeness**.

## 🛠️ 7. Applying CHEERS in Practice

This section provides a practical guide to applying the **Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 checklist** to critically appraise economic evaluation studies. By outlining a systematic approach to reviewing studies section by section and introducing a **practical coding system**, this section equips students with the tools to evaluate the **transparency** and **completeness** of reporting in economic evaluations. These skills are essential for assessing whether studies meet the rigorous standards required by stakeholders, such as Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies, ensuring that findings are **understandable**, **reproducible**, and **policy-relevant**. Mastering this process enables public health professionals to identify high-quality studies and recognize reporting gaps, contributing to **evidence-based decision-making** in resource-constrained health systems.

### How to Use the CHEERS Checklist

The CHEERS 2022 checklist, with its **6 domains** and **28 items**, provides a structured framework for appraising economic evaluations. The following steps outline a systematic approach to applying the checklist, ensuring that each section of a study is evaluated for clarity and completeness:

1. **Read the Article Section by Section**:
    - **Title/Abstract → Introduction → Methods → Results → Discussion**: Review the study systematically, starting with the title and abstract to understand its scope, moving through the introduction to grasp its context, analyzing the methods for technical rigor, evaluating the results for clarity, and assessing the discussion for implications and limitations.
2. **Match Sections to CHEERS Items**:
    - **Use the 6 domains and 28 checklist items as a guide**: Align each section of the study with the corresponding CHEERS domain (e.g., Title & Abstract, Methods) and specific items (e.g., item 8 for perspective, item 10 for discount rate) to ensure all reporting requirements are addressed.
3. **Evaluate Each Item**:
    - ✅ **Clearly and fully reported**?: Determine if the item is reported with sufficient detail to be understandable and reproducible (e.g., specifying a discount rate of 3% with justification).
    - 🟡 **Mentioned but unclear/incomplete**?: Assess whether the item is mentioned but lacks detail or clarity (e.g., stating “QALYs were used” without specifying the utility tool).
    - ❌ **Missing altogether**?: Identify if the item is entirely absent, undermining the study’s transparency (e.g., no mention of the study’s perspective).

This systematic approach ensures that evaluations are thoroughly assessed for **transparency**, enabling stakeholders to determine whether the study can be trusted and applied in policy contexts like Malaysia’s healthcare system.

### Practical Coding System

To facilitate a consistent and objective appraisal, the CHEERS checklist is supported by a **practical coding system** that categorizes the quality of reporting for each item. The following table outlines the symbols and their meanings:

|**Symbol**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|
|✅|Clearly and transparently reported|
|🟡|Mentioned, but unclear or incomplete|
|❌|Not reported|

- **✅ Clearly and transparently reported**: The item is fully documented with sufficient detail to allow understanding and replication (e.g., “A Markov model with 1-year cycles simulated transitions between remission, relapse, and death”).
- **🟡 Mentioned, but unclear or incomplete**: The item is referenced but lacks critical details, making it difficult to assess or replicate (e.g., “A model was used to project results” without specifying the model type).
- **❌ Not reported**: The item is entirely absent, significantly undermining the study’s transparency and utility (e.g., no mention of the discount rate).

**Use this system to systematically critique economic evaluation studies**: By applying these symbols to each of the 28 CHEERS items, students can methodically evaluate a study’s reporting quality, identifying strengths and gaps. This approach is particularly valuable for assessing studies submitted to **HTA agencies** or journals, ensuring they meet the standards required for **policy-relevant** decision-making.

## 🚨 9. Top 5 Common Reporting Gaps

This section identifies the **top five common reporting gaps** in economic evaluations, highlighting frequent deficiencies that undermine the **transparency**, **reproducibility**, and **policy relevance** of studies. These gaps, often observed in published economic evaluations, can prevent stakeholders such as policymakers, researchers, and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agencies like Malaysia’s **MaHTAS** from fully understanding or trusting study findings. By detailing each gap, its implications, and illustrative examples, this section equips students with the ability to recognize and address these issues when appraising studies using the **CHEERS 2022 checklist**. Understanding these gaps is crucial for ensuring that economic evaluations are **clear**, **complete**, and **actionable** in informing **evidence-based health policy** decisions, particularly in resource-constrained settings like Malaysia’s healthcare system.

### Common Reporting Deficiencies in Economic Evaluations

The following are the most frequent reporting deficiencies in economic evaluations, with implications for transparency and policy relevance. Each gap is presented with its **issue**, **why it matters**, and an **example** to illustrate its impact:

1. **Perspective Not Stated**:
    
    - **Issue**: Studies fail to clarify whether the perspective is societal, payer, or provider, leaving ambiguity about the scope of costs and outcomes considered.
    - **Why It Matters**: Perspective determines which costs and outcomes should be included, directly affecting the study’s relevance and applicability. For instance, a societal perspective includes indirect costs like productivity losses, while a payer perspective focuses on reimbursed costs.
    - **Example**: A study includes only drug costs but claims societal relevance, misleading readers about the comprehensiveness of the analysis and potentially skewing policy decisions.
2. **No Justification for Time Horizon or Discount Rate**:
    
    - **Issue**: Time horizons may be chosen arbitrarily, and discounting may be unexplained or omitted entirely, reducing the credibility of long-term projections.
    - **Why It Matters**: Short timeframes can misrepresent chronic disease costs and benefits, while discounting ensures appropriate weighting of future outcomes. Without justification, stakeholders cannot assess the appropriateness of these choices.
    - **Example**: Lifetime outcomes are modeled without reported discounting, making it impossible to evaluate how future costs and benefits were valued, potentially inflating results.
3. **Omission of Sensitivity Analysis**:
    
    - **Issue**: Sensitivity analyses are often missing or inadequately reported, leaving uncertainty in results unaddressed.
    - **Why It Matters**: Policymakers need to understand how uncertainty affects conclusions to make informed decisions. Sensitivity analysis tests the robustness of results, ensuring reliability across varying assumptions.
    - **Example**: A base-case Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is reported without robustness testing, leaving policymakers unsure if the results hold under different conditions.
4. **Incomplete Model Structure Explanation**:
    
    - **Issue**: Models (e.g., decision trees, Markov models) lack details on states, transitions, or cycle length, obscuring the analytical framework.
    - **Why It Matters**: Transparency in model structure allows replication and critical appraisal, ensuring that the study’s methodology is verifiable and trustworthy.
    - **Example**: A Markov model is used without a diagram or state logic provided, preventing researchers from understanding or replicating the model’s design.
5. **Utility Sources Not Reported**:
    
    - **Issue**: Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) calculations lack details on instruments (e.g., EQ-5D, SF-6D) or population-specific value sets, reducing transparency in outcome measurement.
    - **Why It Matters**: Utility weights vary by setting and significantly impact QALY estimates, affecting the study’s conclusions and comparability across contexts.
    - **Example**: A study states “utility weights from the literature” without citation, leaving readers unable to verify the source or appropriateness of the weights.

### Implications for Transparency and Policy Relevance

These reporting gaps have significant implications for the **transparency** and **policy relevance** of economic evaluations:

- **Reduced Trust**: Incomplete or unclear reporting undermines confidence among stakeholders, such as Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health** or **MaHTAS**, making it difficult to rely on the study for decision-making.
- **Limited Reproducibility**: Missing details (e.g., model structure, utility sources) prevent other researchers from replicating the study, reducing its scientific credibility.
- **Inhibited Policy Application**: Without clear reporting, policymakers cannot adapt findings to local contexts (e.g., Malaysia’s healthcare system) or make informed resource allocation decisions, such as prioritizing cancer screening over other interventions.
- **Potential for Misleading Decisions**: Gaps like omitted sensitivity analyses or unstated perspectives can lead to incorrect conclusions, potentially resulting in inefficient or inequitable health policies.

To address these gaps, the **CHEERS 2022 checklist** provides a structured framework to ensure that all critical elements are reported clearly, enhancing the **usability** and **impact** of economic evaluations in health policy.

### Summary Table: Top 5 Common Reporting Gaps

The following table consolidates the key reporting gaps, their implications, and examples to provide a quick reference for students appraising economic evaluations:

|**Reporting Gap**|**Issue**|**Why It Matters**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Perspective Not Stated|Fails to clarify societal, payer, or provider perspective|Determines which costs/outcomes are included|Only drug costs included but claims societal relevance|
|No Justification for Time Horizon or Discount Rate|Arbitrary timeframes or unexplained/omitted discounting|Short timeframes misrepresent chronic disease impacts; discounting weights future outcomes|Lifetime outcomes modeled without reported discounting|
|Omission of Sensitivity Analysis|Missing or inadequate reporting of sensitivity analyses|Policymakers need uncertainty assessment for robust conclusions|Base-case ICER reported without robustness testing|
|Incomplete Model Structure Explanation|Lacks details on model states, transitions, or cycle length|Transparency needed for replication and appraisal|Markov model used without diagram or state logic|
|Utility Sources Not Reported|QALY calculations lack instrument or value set details|Utility weights impact QALY estimates and comparability|“Utility weights from the literature” without citation|

This session equips students with the skills to translate EE results into actionable policy recommendations, navigating the complexities of financial, ethical, and operational constraints. By emphasizing key concepts like **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs)**, **Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG)/case-mix costing**, **Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)**, and **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)**, the lecture prepares future health leaders to influence resource allocation, access, and system evolution in contexts like Malaysia’s public healthcare system. Below is a concise summary of the lecture’s key points, learning outcomes, and critical terminologies, designed to provide a clear overview for policymakers, students, and stakeholders.

### Key Learning Outcomes 🎯

The lecture outlines four core competencies essential for applying EEs in policy:

- **Interpret ICERs**: Understand and evaluate ICERs against WTP thresholds and budget impacts to assess cost-effectiveness and affordability.
- **Explain DRG/Case-Mix Costing**: Describe its role in standardizing costs for national health financing and Health Technology Assessments (HTAs).
- **Compare WTP Thresholds**: Analyze GDP-based and stated preference methods (e.g., Contingent Valuation, Discrete Choice Experiments) to understand societal valuation of health gains.
- **Apply EE Results**: Use structured exercises to simulate policy decisions, balancing cost-effectiveness, equity, and feasibility.

**Why It Matters**: These outcomes enable students to move beyond academic analysis, using EEs to address real-world challenges, such as optimizing Malaysia’s Universal Health Coverage (UHC) framework while ensuring equitable access.

### Lecture Progression and Context 🚀

Lecture IV builds on the preceding sessions in the Economic Evaluation series:

|**Lecture**|**Focus**|**Key Topics**|
|---|---|---|
|**EE I**|Overview|Types of EE (CEA, CUA, CBA), key steps (perspective, costs/outcomes)|
|**EE II**|Conducting EE|Costing (micro-costing, DRG), outcomes (QALYs/DALYs), modeling (decision trees, Markov models)|
|**EE III**|Appraising EE|CHEERS 2022 checklist, identifying gaps (e.g., missing perspective, weak sensitivity analysis)|
|**EE IV**|Applying EE|ICER interpretation, WTP, DRG, MCDA, policy relevance|

**Lecture IV** emphasizes **practical application**, teaching students to use EE tools strategically in the “messy, complex world of policy,” addressing trade-offs like affordability, equity, and system readiness.

### Core Concepts and Insights 🌟

The lecture covers several critical areas, each reinforced through practical examples and frameworks:

#### ICERs and Cost-Effectiveness 📊

- **Definition**: The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** measures the additional cost per additional unit of health outcome (e.g., QALY gained):  
    $$\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{new}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{new}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{comparator}}}$$
- **Insight**: A low ICER is a **good start but not the finish line**. Policy decisions require balancing cost-effectiveness with **budget impact**, **equity**, **clinical context**, and **system readiness**.

#### WTP Thresholds 📏

- **Definition**: The **Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)** threshold is the maximum amount a health system or society is willing to pay for a unit of health gain (e.g., QALY or DALY averted).
- **Sources**: Include 1–3× GDP per capita (e.g., Malaysia: RM 48,000–144,000), WTP studies (Contingent Valuation, Discrete Choice Experiments), historical benchmarks, and deliberative processes.
- **Caution**: Thresholds are **not universal or static**, and a favorable ICER does not guarantee approval due to budget, feasibility, or ethical constraints.

#### DRG/Case-Mix Costing 🏥

- **Definition**: **Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG)/case-mix costing** classifies patients into clinically similar groups with similar resource use, using cost weights and a base rate:  
    $$\text{BR}_t = \frac{\text{HP}_t}{\text{Cases}_{h,t-1}}$$
- **Application**: Used in Malaysia’s MOH and university hospitals for budgeting, reimbursement, and MaHTAS evaluations, though limited by irregular IT infrastructure and data dependency.
- **Insight**: DRG offers **scalability**, while **micro-costing** provides precision, with good EEs choosing the appropriate method based on context.

#### Budget Impact vs. Cost-Effectiveness 💸

- **Insight**: A low ICER does not ensure affordability. **Budget impact** assesses total costs at scale, highlighting trade-offs like **fiscal space**, **opportunity cost**, and **feasibility**.
- **Example**: An intervention with an ICER of RM 95,000 for 1.5 million people costs RM 142.5 million, potentially straining budgets despite cost-effectiveness.

#### Ethical and Equity Considerations ⚖️

- **Dilemma**: Balancing **efficiency** (maximizing health gains) with **equity** (fair access for vulnerable groups).
- **Scenarios**: Policymakers may prioritize high-ICER interventions for **end-of-life care**, **rare diseases**, **marginalized populations**, or **childhood interventions** due to societal values.

#### Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) 🧠

- **Definition**: **MCDA** combines evidence with values, scoring criteria like cost-effectiveness, equity, and feasibility to inform decisions.
- **Example**: HPV self-sampling scores high in MCDA due to strong ICER, equity benefits, and feasibility, unlike diabetes screening, which is limited by high budget impact.
- **Insight**: MCDA ensures **transparent, balanced decisions**, integrating evidence, ethics, and economics.

#### Policy-Relevant EEs 📜

- **Features**: Must be **timely**, **context-specific** (using local data like Malaysian EQ-5D tariffs), **actionable**, and aligned with policy mandates.
- **Contrast**: Unlike academic EEs, which focus on methodological novelty, policy-relevant EEs address urgent questions and include budget impact.

### Key Terminologies Introduced 📘

- **Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)**: The maximum amount society is willing to pay for a health gain, used as a threshold for ICERs.
- **Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG)/Case-Mix Costing**: A method to classify patients into groups with similar resource use, with costs calculated using a base rate:  
    $$\text{BR}_t = \frac{\text{HP}_t}{\text{Cases}_{h,t-1}}$$
- **Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY)**: A measure of health outcome combining quality and quantity of life.
- **Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY)**: A measure of disease burden, reflecting years lost due to disability or premature death.
- **Budget Impact**: The total cost of implementing an intervention across a population, assessing affordability.
- **Fiscal Space**: A government’s capacity to fund interventions without jeopardizing (jeopardizing) financial stability.
- **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)**: A framework to combine evidence, values, and constraints for decision-making.
- **Contingent Valuation (CV)**: A survey method directly asking individuals their WTP for health outcomes.
- **Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE)**: A survey method presenting hypothetical options to infer WTP through trade-offs.
- **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)**: A systematic evaluation of health interventions, often using ICERs and WTP.
- **MaHTAS**: Malaysian Health Technology Assessment Section, supporting EE for policy decisions.
- **UNU-CBG Grouper**: A tool for generating DRG codes in Malaysia’s casemix system.
- **Equity**: Fair distribution of health resources, prioritizing vulnerable or marginalized groups.

### Key Takeaways for Future Health Leaders 🌟

- **ICER ≠ Final Answer**: Context, budget, equity, and feasibility are critical for policy decisions.
- **DRG Scalability**: Supports national financing and HTAs, though limited by data and IT challenges.
- **WTP Flexibility**: Public preferences enhance threshold relevance beyond GDP-based metrics.
- **Policy Impact**: EEs must be timely, context-specific, and actionable to shape access and system evolution.

## 3. From Numbers to Decisions: Understanding ICERs 📊

The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** serves as a cornerstone of economic evaluation, providing a critical metric to compare the value of health interventions. However, a low ICER alone is not sufficient for policy approval, as real-world health policy decisions demand a broader perspective that accounts for financial, ethical, and practical considerations. This section delves into the definition, calculation, and interpretation of ICERs, while highlighting why a favorable ICER is only the starting point in the complex landscape of health policy decision-making.

### What is an ICER? 🧮

The ICER quantifies the **additional cost per additional unit of health outcome** when comparing two interventions, offering a standardized way to assess the cost-effectiveness of a new intervention relative to a comparator (e.g., standard care). It is expressed mathematically as:

$$\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{new}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{new}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{comparator}}}$$

- **Interpretation**: The ICER represents the **extra cost per extra unit of outcome**, such as per **Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY)** gained. A lower ICER indicates better cost-effectiveness, as it suggests that the additional health benefits are achieved at a relatively lower cost.
- **Example**: If a new treatment costs RM 10,000 more than the comparator and yields 0.5 additional QALYs, the ICER is calculated as:

$$\text{ICER} = \frac{10000}{0.5} = 20000 \text{ RM per QALY}$$

This means the new treatment costs **RM 20,000 per additional QALY gained**. To determine if this is cost-effective, the ICER must be compared to a **Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)** threshold, which reflects the maximum amount a health system or society is willing to pay for a unit of health gain.

**Why It Matters**: The ICER provides a clear, quantifiable metric to guide resource allocation decisions, helping policymakers prioritize interventions that deliver the most health benefits for the available budget. However, its utility depends on contextual factors, such as the threshold used and the broader policy environment.

### Why a Good ICER Isn’t Enough? 🚫

While a low ICER indicates that an intervention is cost-effective on a per-patient basis, it does not guarantee policy approval. **Policy decisions require consideration of additional factors** that go beyond the mathematical elegance of the ICER. These factors ensure that interventions are not only cost-effective but also feasible, equitable, and aligned with the health system’s capacity and societal values. The following table outlines these critical considerations:

|**Factor**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)** 🎯|Is the ICER below the country’s cost-effectiveness threshold? For example, if Malaysia’s WTP threshold is RM 120,000 per QALY, an ICER of RM 20,000 is favorable, but an ICER of RM 150,000 may be deemed too costly.|
|**Budget Impact** 💰|Can the intervention be afforded at scale, even if cost-effective per patient? A low ICER for a treatment may still result in unsustainable costs if applied to a large population.|
|**Equity & Ethics** ⚖️|Who benefits? Are vulnerable or marginalized groups reached? Interventions that prioritize underserved populations may be favored, even if their ICERs are higher.|
|**Clinical Context** 📈|Is the health benefit significant enough to matter in practice? A statistically significant QALY gain may be clinically negligible, reducing its policy relevance.|
|**System Readiness** 🏥|Can the health system feasibly implement the intervention? Factors like infrastructure, trained staff, and supply chains must be in place for successful adoption.|

The ICER is a powerful tool for comparing interventions, but its limitations become apparent in policy contexts where resources are finite and priorities compete. For instance, an intervention with a low ICER may be unaffordable if it requires significant upfront investments or if it diverts funds from other critical services (opportunity cost). Similarly, ethical considerations, such as ensuring access for rural or low-income populations, may outweigh a slightly higher ICER. The health system’s capacity to deliver the intervention—such as the availability of specialized equipment or trained personnel—further complicates decisions. Thus, while the ICER provides a starting point, it must be interpreted within a broader framework that accounts for these real-world constraints.

**Key Takeaway**: A low ICER is a **good start but not the finish line**. Policy decisions require more than just mathematics, as they must balance cost-effectiveness with affordability, fairness, clinical relevance, and practical feasibility. This holistic approach ensures that health policies maximize societal benefit while addressing the diverse needs of the population.

## 4. Cost-Effectiveness Thresholds: Judging ICERs 📏

A **cost-effectiveness threshold** is a pivotal concept in health economics, defining the **maximum amount a health system or society is willing to pay** for one unit of health gain, such as one **Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY)** gained or one **Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY)** averted. This threshold serves as a benchmark for evaluating the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** of an intervention, guiding policymakers in determining whether an intervention represents good value for money. This section explores how cost-effectiveness is determined, the sources of WTP thresholds, and critical cautions to consider when applying these thresholds in policy decisions, ensuring that students understand both the mechanics and the nuanced challenges of using thresholds in practice.

### How is Cost-Effectiveness Determined? ✅

An intervention is deemed **cost-effective** if its ICER is **below the WTP threshold**, indicating that the additional cost per unit of health gain is within what the health system or society is willing to pay. The ICER, calculated as:

$$\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{new}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{new}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{comparator}}}$$

is compared against the WTP threshold to make funding decisions. The following table illustrates this process with examples:

|**ICER (RM per QALY)**|**WTP Threshold (RM per QALY)**|**Decision**|
|---|---|---|
|60,000|120,000|✅ Cost-effective|
|150,000|120,000|❌ Not cost-effective|

In the first example, an ICER of RM 60,000 per QALY is well below the WTP threshold of RM 120,000, suggesting that the intervention is a cost-effective use of resources. Conversely, an ICER of RM 150,000 exceeds the threshold, indicating that the intervention is not cost-effective unless other factors (e.g., equity or unmet need) justify its funding. This comparison is central to **Health Technology Assessments (HTAs)**, where policymakers use thresholds to prioritize interventions that maximize health benefits within budget constraints. However, the threshold’s value and its application can vary significantly, influenced by economic, social, and political contexts.

### Sources of WTP Thresholds 🌐

Thresholds vary by country and are derived from multiple methods, each with its own strengths and limitations. Understanding these sources is crucial for interpreting ICERs in context and appreciating the diversity of approaches to setting thresholds. The following table summarizes the primary methods:

|**Method**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**1–3× GDP per capita**|Early WHO-CHOICE guidance (e.g., Malaysia: RM 48,000–144,000). This method ties thresholds to a country’s economic capacity, assuming that health systems can afford to pay one to three times the per capita GDP for a QALY or DALY averted.|
|**WTP Studies (CV/DCE)**|Surveys of how much individuals or society would pay for a QALY, using methods like **Contingent Valuation (CV)** or **Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE)**. These capture societal preferences but may be influenced by survey design and respondent biases.|
|**Historical Benchmarks**|Based on past funding decisions (revealed preferences). This method reflects actual spending patterns but may perpetuate existing inequities or inefficiencies.|
|**Deliberative Process**|HTA panels or policy consensus (e.g., Thailand’s HTA committee). This involves expert and stakeholder input to set thresholds, balancing evidence with societal values and policy goals.|

The **1–3× GDP per capita** method, rooted in WHO-CHOICE guidance, provides a simple, economically grounded benchmark, particularly useful for low- and middle-income countries like Malaysia, where thresholds might range from RM 48,000 to RM 144,000 based on GDP. However, this approach may not fully capture societal preferences or health system priorities. **WTP studies**, such as CV and DCE, offer a more nuanced view by directly surveying individuals, but their results can vary depending on how questions are framed or who is surveyed. **Historical benchmarks** provide practical insight into what a health system has been willing to pay, but they may not align with current priorities. **Deliberative processes**, like those used in Thailand, integrate evidence and stakeholder perspectives, making them context-specific but resource-intensive. Each method contributes to a richer understanding of cost-effectiveness, but their variability underscores the need for careful interpretation.

### Cautions ⚠️

Applying cost-effectiveness thresholds requires caution, as their use is fraught with complexities that can impact policy decisions. The following points highlight key considerations:

- **Thresholds are not universal or static**: They vary by country, context, and time. For example, a threshold suitable for Malaysia may not apply to a wealthier nation, and economic changes can shift thresholds over time.
- A **favorable ICER** does not guarantee policy approval due to:
    - **Budget impact**: Total cost at scale may be unaffordable, even if the ICER is low. For instance, a cost-effective intervention for a large population could strain national budgets.
    - **Feasibility**: Implementation challenges, such as inadequate infrastructure or trained personnel, may limit adoption, regardless of cost-effectiveness.
    - **Ethical implications**: Equity and fairness considerations may override cost-effectiveness. For example, interventions targeting marginalized groups might be prioritized despite higher ICERs to address health disparities.
- **Key Insight**: Thresholds provide a reference point, but real decisions require **context, judgment, and constraints**. Policymakers must weigh cost-effectiveness against practical realities and societal values to ensure equitable and sustainable health policies.

The variability of thresholds highlights their role as **guidelines rather than rigid rules**. For instance, a low ICER may not lead to funding if the intervention’s total cost exceeds the health system’s fiscal space, forcing policymakers to consider opportunity costs (e.g., what other services might be sacrificed). Similarly, **feasibility** issues, such as the need for specialized equipment or extensive training, can render a cost-effective intervention impractical. **Ethical considerations**, such as prioritizing rare diseases or end-of-life care, may lead to exceptions where higher ICERs are accepted to meet societal or moral imperatives. This nuanced approach ensures that thresholds are applied thoughtfully, balancing economic rigor with the realities of health system capacity and societal priorities.

## 5. Exercise: Which Intervention is Worth Funding? 🧑‍⚖️

This exercise immerses students in a realistic **policy decision-making scenario**, challenging them to advise the Ministry of Health on which of three interventions to fund, based on economic evaluation data. With a **Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) threshold** of RM 120,000 per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY), students must weigh the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs)** alongside other critical factors such as budget impact, feasibility, and equity. The exercise underscores the complexity of health policy decisions, where cost-effectiveness is just one piece of a multifaceted puzzle. By engaging with this scenario, students learn to apply economic evaluation principles practically, developing the rationale needed to justify funding decisions in the "messy, complex world of policy."

### Intervention Data 📊

The exercise provides data from three recent economic evaluations, detailing the ICER, budget impact, target population, and feasibility notes for each intervention. The following table summarizes the key information:

|**Intervention**|**ICER (RM per QALY)**|**Total Budget Impact (Annual)**|**Target Population Size**|**Feasibility Notes**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**A: HPV Self-Sampling**|85,000|RM 50 million|500,000 women|Mobile deployment required|
|**B: Stroke Rehabilitation**|130,000|RM 15 million|80,000 patients|Implemented in select rehab centers|
|**C: Type 2 DM Screening**|95,000|RM 200 million|1.5 million adults|High staff training and IT cost upfront|

The data presents a diverse set of interventions, each targeting different health challenges and populations. **HPV self-sampling** aims to improve cervical cancer screening among women, with a moderate ICER and budget impact but requiring mobile infrastructure. **Stroke rehabilitation** focuses on a smaller, specialized population, with a higher ICER but lower budget impact, leveraging existing rehab centers. **Type 2 diabetes screening** addresses a large population with significant public health implications, but its high budget impact and upfront costs pose challenges. This diversity forces students to consider not only cost-effectiveness but also the scale, feasibility, and societal impact of each intervention, mirroring real-world policy dilemmas.

### Discussion Questions ❓

To guide the decision-making process, the exercise poses five critical questions that encourage students to analyze the data holistically and justify their recommendations:

1. **Which ICERs are below the WTP threshold?**
    - Students must identify which interventions have ICERs less than RM 120,000 per QALY, indicating cost-effectiveness.
2. **Which intervention has the most favorable ICER?**
    - This requires comparing ICERs to determine which intervention offers the best value for money relative to the threshold.
3. **Does budget impact change your recommendation?**
    - Students must assess whether the total cost of implementing an intervention at scale affects its viability, even if it is cost-effective.
4. **What if equity is a policy priority?**
    - This question prompts consideration of whether interventions targeting underserved or vulnerable groups (e.g., women, rural populations) should be prioritized.
5. **What if the program must be implemented within 12 months?**
    - Students must evaluate feasibility constraints, such as the time required for infrastructure development or training.

These questions are designed to push students beyond a simplistic ICER comparison, encouraging them to grapple with **trade-offs**. For example, an intervention with a low ICER might be unaffordable due to high budget impact, or a feasible intervention might not align with equity goals. The question about a 12-month implementation timeline highlights the urgency often faced in policy contexts, where delays can undermine public health goals. By addressing these questions, students develop a nuanced understanding of how economic evaluations inform, but do not dictate, policy decisions.

### Key Insights from the Exercise 🌟

The exercise yields several critical insights that reinforce the practical application of economic evaluation in policy-making:

- **No right or wrong answer**: The rationale behind the decision is critical. The exercise emphasizes that the strength of a recommendation lies in its justification, which must account for multiple dimensions of value.
- **Contextual trade-offs** include:
    - **Affordability**: Can the budget support the intervention at scale? For instance, Type 2 DM screening’s RM 200 million annual cost may strain resources despite its favorable ICER.
    - **Scale**: How many people will benefit? HPV self-sampling and Type 2 DM screening target large populations, while stroke rehabilitation serves a smaller group.
    - **Feasibility**: Is the infrastructure ready? Mobile deployment for HPV self-sampling or IT upgrades for diabetes screening may pose logistical challenges.
    - **Urgency**: Can it be implemented quickly? Stroke rehabilitation, using existing centers, may be faster to roll out than interventions requiring new systems.
    - **Equity**: Does it address underserved populations? HPV self-sampling may prioritize women’s health, potentially addressing gender-based health disparities.
- **Conclusion**: Even if interventions are cost-effective, policy decisions require **value judgments** based on multiple criteria. This highlights the need for a balanced approach that integrates economic evidence with ethical, practical, and societal considerations.

The insight that there is **no right or wrong answer** underscores the subjective nature of policy decisions, where different stakeholders may prioritize different criteria (e.g., cost vs. equity). The listed trade-offs reflect real-world complexities: **affordability** ensures fiscal sustainability, **scale** determines public health impact, **feasibility** addresses system capacity, **urgency** aligns with policy timelines, and **equity** ensures fairness. For example, a policymaker might favor HPV self-sampling for its moderate cost and equity benefits, while another might choose stroke rehabilitation for its lower budget impact and faster implementation. The exercise teaches students to articulate these trade-offs clearly, preparing them to navigate stakeholder negotiations and defend their recommendations with robust evidence.

## 6. Budget Impact vs. Cost-Effectiveness 💸

While a low **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** signals that an intervention is cost-effective on a per-patient basis, it does not guarantee **affordability** when scaled across a population. **Budget impact** assesses the **total cost** of implementing an intervention for the target population, revealing whether a health system can sustain the financial burden. This section explores the distinction between cost-effectiveness and budget impact, using examples to illustrate their interplay, and highlights the policy trade-offs that policymakers must navigate to ensure interventions are both valuable and feasible. By understanding these concepts, students can better appreciate the fiscal realities that shape health policy decisions.

### Example Comparison 📊

To illustrate the difference between cost-effectiveness and budget impact, consider two hypothetical interventions, both evaluated against a **Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) threshold** of RM 120,000 per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY). The following table compares their ICERs, population sizes, and total costs:

|**ICER (RM per QALY)**|**Total Population Impacted**|**Total Cost to Health System**|
|---|---|---|
|85,000|500,000 people|RM 42.5 million|
|95,000|1.5 million people|RM 142.5 million|

- **Observation**: Both interventions are **cost-effective** (ICER < RM 120,000), but the second costs **3× more** overall due to its larger target population.
- **Implication**: Budget constraints may prioritize the lower-cost intervention, even if its ICER is slightly higher, as the total financial burden is more manageable.

The example underscores a critical distinction: **cost-effectiveness** focuses on the cost per unit of health gain (e.g., per QALY), while **budget impact** considers the **aggregate cost** of rolling out the intervention. The first intervention, with an ICER of RM 85,000, is more cost-effective and requires only RM 42.5 million annually, making it attractive for budget-constrained systems. The second, despite a still-acceptable ICER of RM 95,000, demands RM 142.5 million due to its larger scale, potentially straining resources. This comparison highlights why policymakers must look beyond ICERs to ensure fiscal sustainability, especially in resource-limited settings like Malaysia’s public health system.

### Why Budget Impact Matters 📋

The distinction between cost-effectiveness and budget impact is crucial for understanding their roles in health policy. The following table compares their key aspects:

|**Aspect**|**Cost-Effectiveness**|**Budget Impact**|
|---|---|---|
|**Focus**|Cost per QALY is low|Total national spend may be too high|
|**Purpose**|Justifies value-for-money|Addresses affordability and fiscal space|
|**Use Case**|Suitable for HTA decisions|Weighed against competing priorities|

- **Fiscal Space**: A government’s capacity to undertake additional spending or revenue reductions without **kindizing** (jeopardizing) its financial stability. This concept is critical for assessing whether a health system can absorb the costs of a new intervention without compromising other services.
- **Key Question**: Policymakers ask, “Can we afford it for everyone who needs it?” not just “Is it worth it per patient?” This shift in perspective ensures that interventions align with the health system’s overall financial capacity.

**Elaboration**: **Cost-effectiveness**, measured by the ICER, is a cornerstone of **Health Technology Assessments (HTAs)**, helping to identify interventions that deliver the most health benefits per unit of cost. However, a low ICER does not address whether the health system can afford to implement the intervention across the entire target population. **Budget impact** fills this gap by quantifying the total financial commitment, which is critical for planning and prioritization. For example, an intervention with a low ICER may still be rejected if its budget impact exceeds the available **fiscal space**, forcing policymakers to consider trade-offs with other health programs. The term “kindizing” (likely a typo for “jeopardizing” in the original text) emphasizes the risk to financial stability, underscoring the importance of aligning interventions with budgetary realities.

### Policy Trade-Offs ⚖️

Implementing a cost-effective intervention requires navigating several trade-offs to ensure it is affordable and feasible at scale. The following table outlines key factors and considerations:

|**Factor**|**Consideration**|
|---|---|
|**Fiscal Space**|Is this within the current Ministry of Health budget? Limited budgets may restrict funding, even for cost-effective interventions.|
|**Opportunity Cost**|What other services would be displaced? Funding one intervention may reduce resources for other critical programs.|
|**Implementation Feasibility**|Is the delivery infrastructure in place? Interventions requiring new systems or training may face delays or increased costs.|

- **Conclusion**: An intervention must be **both cost-effective and affordable** to be implementable at scale. Policymakers must balance the value of health gains with the practical realities of budget constraints and system capacity.

The trade-offs listed highlight the multidimensional nature of health policy decisions. **Fiscal space** is a limiting factor in many health systems, particularly in publicly funded systems like Malaysia’s, where budgets are fixed and competing priorities abound. **Opportunity cost** forces policymakers to consider what might be sacrificed—e.g., funding diabetes screening might reduce resources for maternal health programs. **Implementation feasibility** is equally critical; an intervention requiring extensive infrastructure (e.g., new IT systems) may be cost-effective but impractical within a short timeframe. The conclusion that interventions must be **both cost-effective and affordable** emphasizes the need for a pragmatic approach, where economic evaluations inform but do not dictate decisions. Policymakers must integrate budget impact analyses with ICERs to ensure that interventions are sustainable and aligned with public health goals.

## 7. Costing in Policy: The Role of DRG/Case-Mix Costing 🏥

**Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG)** or **case-mix costing** is a cornerstone of health economics, offering a **standardized method** for classifying patients and estimating healthcare costs. Widely used in policy and economic evaluations, DRG systems facilitate efficient resource allocation and budgeting in healthcare systems. This section explores the definition, mechanics, and applications of DRG/case-mix costing, with a focus on its implementation in Malaysia, its limitations, and its comparison with micro-costing. By understanding DRG’s role, students can appreciate how it transforms clinical data into **scalable, policy-relevant tools** that bridge patient care and national financing strategies.

### What is DRG/Case-Mix Costing? 📋

- **Definition**: DRGs classify patients into **clinically similar groups** expected to consume **similar healthcare resources**. This system groups patients based on shared characteristics, such as diagnoses or procedures, to streamline cost estimation.
- **Mechanism**: Each DRG group is assigned a **cost weight** based on the average cost of care, which is multiplied by a **base rate** to estimate **reimbursement or cost per admission**. This standardized approach simplifies costing across diverse patient populations.
- **Purpose**: Provides **scalable, standardized cost estimates** for budgeting, reimbursement, and economic evaluations, enabling health systems to manage resources efficiently and support policy decisions.

DRG/case-mix costing is designed to balance clinical accuracy with administrative efficiency. By grouping patients with similar resource needs (e.g., all appendectomy patients), it reduces the complexity of individual cost calculations while maintaining relevance for hospital financing and policy planning. This scalability makes DRG a vital tool for **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)** systems, where standardized costing supports equitable resource distribution across large populations. The **cost weight** reflects the relative resource intensity of each group, while the **base rate** adjusts for local economic conditions, making DRG adaptable to different healthcare systems.

### How DRG-Based Costing Works 🛠️

The process of DRG-based costing follows a systematic approach to translate clinical data into financial estimates:

1. **Classify Patient**: Based on **diagnosis, procedures, and comorbidities**, patients are categorized using clinical data from medical records.
2. **Assign DRG Group**: Each patient is assigned to a specific DRG group that reflects their clinical profile and expected resource use.
3. **Determine Cost Weight**: Each DRG group has a **relative cost weight** (e.g., Appendectomy = 0.85, Stroke = 1.7), representing the average resource intensity relative to a baseline procedure.
4. **Calculate Cost**: Multiply the DRG weight by the **national base rate** to calculate the cost per case, providing a standardized cost estimate.
5. **Apply Cost Estimates**: These estimates are used for **reimbursement, budgeting, or economic evaluation (EE) inputs**, informing hospital financing and policy decisions.

This stepwise process ensures that costs are estimated consistently across hospitals and patient groups, facilitating fair reimbursement and efficient budgeting. For example, a stroke patient (DRG weight = 1.7) requires more resources than an appendectomy patient (DRG weight = 0.85), and the cost calculation reflects this difference. By relying on clinical coding, DRG systems link medical practice to financial outcomes, making them indispensable for large-scale health policy applications, such as setting provider payments or evaluating new interventions in **Health Technology Assessments (HTAs)**.

### Base Rate Formula 📊

The **base rate (BR)** is a critical component of DRG costing, determined by the hospital’s budget and patient volume:

$$\text{BR}_t = \frac{\text{HP}_t}{\text{Cases}_{h,t-1}}$$

- **$\text{BR}_t$**: Base rate in year ( t ), representing the average cost per encounter.
- **$\text{HP}_t$**: Hospital Pool (budget) in year ( t ), reflecting the total financial resources allocated to the hospital.
- **$\text{Cases}_{h,t-1}$**: Total number of patients in hospital ( h ) in year ( t-1 ), used as a denominator to average costs across cases.
- **Interpretation**: The base rate reflects the **average cost per encounter**, adjusted for hospital budget and patient load, ensuring that cost estimates align with the facility’s financial capacity.

The base rate formula ensures that DRG costs are context-specific, accounting for variations in hospital budgets and patient volumes. For instance, a hospital with a larger budget or fewer patients will have a higher base rate, reflecting higher per-case costs. This formula allows DRG systems to adapt to different healthcare settings, making them versatile for national or regional policy applications. The use of the previous year’s patient volume ((\text{Cases}_{h,t-1})) ensures stability in cost estimates, as current-year data may be incomplete during budgeting.

### Why DRG Matters for Policy and EE 🌍

DRG/case-mix costing is a powerful tool for health policy and economic evaluations, offering several benefits:

|**Use Case**|**Benefit**|
|---|---|
|**Large-Scale Costing in HTAs**|Faster, standardized estimation for many services, enabling efficient evaluation of interventions across populations.|
|**Setting Tariffs and Provider Payments**|Ensures **fair and predictable hospital financing**, aligning payments with resource use.|
|**Comparing Hospitals or Programs**|Benchmarks **efficiency** using case-mix adjusted outputs, allowing comparisons across facilities or health programs.|

DRG’s ability to provide **standardized, scalable cost estimates** makes it ideal for **HTAs**, where rapid costing of multiple interventions is needed. For provider payments, DRG ensures that hospitals are reimbursed based on the complexity of cases, promoting fairness and transparency. When comparing hospitals, DRG adjusts for differences in patient complexity, enabling policymakers to identify efficient facilities or programs. These applications make DRG a linchpin for **evidence-based policy**, supporting decisions that optimize resource allocation and improve health system performance.

### Malaysia’s Use of DRG 🇲🇾

- **Implementation**: The **casemix system** is used in **Ministry of Health (MOH)** and **university hospitals** in Malaysia, integrating DRG into healthcare financing.
- **Tool**: The **UNU-CBG Grouper** generates DRG codes, translating clinical data into standardized groups for costing.
- **Applications**:
    - Supports **internal costing studies** and **MaHTAS (Malaysian Health Technology Assessment Section)** economic evaluations, providing data for policy decisions.
    - **Cost per episode** is preferred over itemized billing for **generalizability**, as it simplifies cost comparisons across diverse settings.
- **Challenges**: Malaysia’s public healthcare system is not yet fully ready for **DRG-based payments** due to:
    - **Irregular IT infrastructure**, which hinders consistent data collection and coding.
    - **Need for standardized digital health systems and training** to ensure accurate DRG assignment and cost estimation.
    - **Requirement for stakeholder engagement and transparency** in tariff setting to build trust and acceptance among hospital administrators, clinicians, and policymakers.

Malaysia’s adoption of the casemix system reflects a commitment to modernizing healthcare financing, particularly in **MOH and university hospitals**. The **UNU-CBG Grouper** automates DRG coding, ensuring consistency, but the system’s effectiveness depends on robust IT infrastructure and trained personnel. The preference for **cost per episode** over itemized billing enhances generalizability, making it easier to compare costs across hospitals or regions. However, challenges like outdated IT systems and the need for stakeholder buy-in highlight the complexity of transitioning to DRG-based payments. These hurdles require significant investment and time—potentially up to five years, as noted in related discussions—emphasizing the need for strategic planning and capacity building.

### Limitations of DRG Costing ⚠️

- **Less Precise**: Not as accurate as micro-costing, especially for **new interventions** where cost weights may not yet exist.
- **Misses Outliers**: May not capture costs of **non-standardized or outlier care**, such as rare conditions or complex cases.
- **Data Dependency**: Requires **robust clinical coding and data systems** to ensure accurate patient classification and cost estimation.
- **Conclusion**: DRG offers **scalable, standardized inputs** for policy and EE, particularly in **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)** and **hospital payment reform**, but its limitations must be acknowledged.

While DRG’s standardized approach is a strength, its reliance on averages can obscure patient-specific variations, making it less suitable for novel or highly variable interventions. For instance, a new cancer therapy may not fit existing DRG codes, requiring **micro-costing** for precision. Similarly, **outlier cases** (e.g., patients with multiple comorbidities) may incur costs that exceed DRG estimates, leading to underfunding for hospitals. The dependence on **robust clinical coding** underscores the need for high-quality data systems, which can be a barrier in resource-constrained settings like Malaysia. Despite these limitations, DRG remains a critical tool for **UHC** and payment reform, as it provides a scalable framework for managing costs across large populations.

### DRG vs. Micro-Costing 📊

The following table compares **DRG/case-mix** and **micro-costing**, highlighting their definitions, uses, and trade-offs:

|**Approach**|**DRG/Case-Mix**|**Micro-Costing**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Classifies patients into groups with similar resource use; cost based on group weight × base rate|Itemizes every resource used per patient and assigns actual unit cost|
|**Detail Level**|Medium|Very high (line-item detail)|
|**Common Use**|Hospital claims, provider payments, HTAs|Clinical trials, detailed hospital studies|
|**Strengths**|Fast, scalable, standardized; used in real-world systems|Precise, patient-specific cost; ideal for new interventions|
|**Limitations**|Averaged; may miss variation within group|Labor-intensive, less scalable|

**Elaboration**: **DRG/case-mix costing** excels in scenarios requiring rapid, standardized cost estimates, such as hospital budgeting or national HTAs. Its medium detail level balances accuracy and efficiency, making it practical for real-world systems. **Micro-costing**, by contrast, provides granular, patient-specific data, ideal for research or novel interventions but impractical for large-scale applications due to its time-intensive nature. The trade-off between **scalability** (DRG) and **precision** (micro-costing) is a key consideration in EE, requiring policymakers to choose the appropriate method based on the context and goals of the evaluation.

### When to Use DRG vs. Micro-Costing? 🤔

Choosing between DRG and micro-costing depends on the evaluation’s scope and objectives:

|**Use DRG When…**|**Use Micro-Costing When…**|
|---|---|
|Doing national or provider-level costing|Evaluating a new intervention in a single hospital|
|Feeding large-scale EE models (e.g., MaHTAS)|Collecting data for trial-based cost-effectiveness|
|Estimating average cost of common procedures|Exploring variation across patients or protocols|

**DRG** is preferred for **national or provider-level costing**, such as setting hospital budgets or informing MaHTAS evaluations, due to its ability to handle large datasets efficiently. It is also ideal for **common procedures** with established cost weights. **Micro-costing**, however, is better suited for **clinical trials** or **new interventions**, where detailed cost data is needed to capture variability. For example, evaluating a new surgical technique in a single hospital might require micro-costing to account for unique resource use, while DRG is more appropriate for routine procedures like appendectomies. Understanding when to use each method ensures that EEs are both accurate and practical.

### Policy Application 🌟

- **DRG-Based Costing**: Widely accepted for **HTA submissions** and **provider payment reforms** (e.g., capitation, bundled payment), as it provides standardized, scalable cost estimates.
- **Micro-Costing**: Better suited for **research trials**, **early-phase HTA**, and **new technologies** not yet covered by DRG codes, where precision is critical.
- **Key Insight**: **Micro-costing gives precision; DRG gives scalability**. Good EEs know when to use each or both, depending on the policy context.
- **Role in Policy**: DRG systems turn **clinical data into budgetary tools**, connecting patient care to **national financing strategy**, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and equitably.

In policy contexts, **DRG-based costing** supports reforms like **capitation** (fixed payments per patient) or **bundled payments** (single payments for an episode of care), promoting predictability and fairness in hospital financing. **Micro-costing**, while less common in policy, is invaluable for early-stage evaluations of innovative treatments, where DRG codes may not yet exist. The **key insight**—balancing precision and scalability—highlights the complementary roles of these methods. For instance, a national UHC program might use DRG for routine services but rely on micro-costing for pilot projects. By transforming clinical data into **budgetary tools**, DRG systems align patient care with national priorities, supporting equitable access and efficient resource use in health systems like Malaysia’s.

## 8. Willingness-to-Pay (WTP): Valuing Health Gains 💰

**Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)** is a critical concept in health economics, reflecting the **maximum amount an individual or society is willing to pay** for a unit of health gain, such as one **Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY)**, one **Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY)** averted, or one case prevented. WTP serves as a cornerstone for determining cost-effectiveness thresholds and guiding health policy decisions. This section explores the role of WTP in policy, methods for its measurement, factors influencing its estimates, and a practical example of a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE). By understanding WTP, students can better grasp how societal values shape resource allocation in healthcare, ensuring that policies align with both economic and ethical priorities.

### Why is WTP Useful in Policy? 🌍

WTP is a vital tool in health policy, providing a framework to assess the value society places on health outcomes and guiding decisions on resource allocation. The following table outlines its key applications:

|**Application**|**Role of WTP**|
|---|---|
|**HTA & Economic Evaluation**|Benchmarks for ICER comparison, helping determine whether an intervention’s Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is acceptable.|
|**National Drug Pricing & Coverage**|Justifies price caps or inclusion/exclusion decisions, ensuring that drugs and treatments align with societal affordability.|
|**Benefit Package Design (e.g., UHC)**|Determines what services are worth funding, shaping the scope of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) benefit packages.|

**Elaboration**: WTP is instrumental in **Health Technology Assessments (HTAs)**, where it provides a threshold against which ICERs are compared to assess cost-effectiveness. For example, if a new drug’s ICER exceeds the WTP threshold, it may be excluded from coverage. In **national drug pricing**, WTP helps set price caps, ensuring affordability while incentivizing innovation. For **UHC benefit package design**, WTP informs which services (e.g., screenings, treatments) should be prioritized to maximize health gains within budget constraints. By reflecting societal preferences, WTP ensures that health policies are both economically sound and socially acceptable, aligning with Malaysia’s goals for equitable healthcare access.

### How is WTP Measured? 📊

WTP is estimated using two primary methods: **Contingent Valuation (CV)** and **Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE)**. Each method has distinct approaches, steps, strengths, and limitations, as summarized in the following table:

|**Method**|**Contingent Valuation (CV)**|**Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Approach**|Directly asks: “How much would you pay for [health intervention/outcome]?”|Presents hypothetical options with different attributes (e.g., effectiveness, cost).|
|**Steps**|1. Describe hypothetical scenario (e.g., vaccine, screening, cure).  <br>2. Ask respondents to state a price (open-ended or bidding format).  <br>3. Calculate mean or median WTP.|1. Identify attributes (e.g., effectiveness, side effects, cost).  <br>2. Construct scenarios with varying combinations.  <br>3. Respondents choose between options.  <br>4. Use statistical models (e.g., conditional logit) to estimate the implicit value of each attribute.  <br>5. Derive WTP per unit (e.g., per QALY).|
|**Strengths**|✅ Simple, direct approach, easy to implement and understand.|✅ Captures trade-offs, reflecting how individuals prioritize attributes like effectiveness over cost.|
|**Limitations**|⚠️ Prone to hypothetical bias or overestimation, as respondents may overstate their willingness to pay in hypothetical scenarios.|⚠️ Requires careful design and analysis, as complex scenarios can confuse respondents or lead to biased results.|

**Elaboration**: **Contingent Valuation (CV)** is straightforward, asking respondents directly how much they would pay for a health outcome, such as a new vaccine. Its simplicity makes it accessible, but **hypothetical bias**—where respondents give inflated answers due to the hypothetical nature of the question—can skew results. **Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs)**, by contrast, present respondents with realistic trade-offs (e.g., choosing between a more effective but costlier treatment), using statistical models to infer WTP. While DCEs better capture preferences, they require **careful design** to avoid overwhelming respondents with complex choices. Both methods contribute to setting WTP thresholds, but their accuracy depends on robust survey design and representative sampling, particularly in diverse populations like Malaysia’s.

### Factors Influencing WTP Estimates 🔍

Several factors influence the accuracy and variability of WTP estimates, reflecting the complexity of capturing societal values:

- **Income and Education Level**: Higher income/education often correlates with higher WTP, as wealthier or more educated individuals may prioritize health investments.
- **Framing of Scenario**: The **severity or urgency** of the health condition affects responses. For example, respondents may be willing to pay more for a life-saving treatment than a preventive measure.
- **Cultural Attitudes**: Attitudes toward **risk and fairness** vary by society, influencing WTP. In some cultures, collective responsibility may lead to higher WTP for public health programs.
- **Public Funding Awareness**: Concerns about **equity and public budgets** influence WTP, as respondents may lower their estimates if they expect government subsidies.
- **Key Insight**: WTP reflects **societal values** for health, but its estimation requires **careful design and interpretation** to account for these influencing factors.

**Elaboration**: These factors highlight the dynamic nature of WTP estimates. For instance, in Malaysia, where income disparities exist, **income and education levels** can significantly affect WTP, potentially skewing thresholds toward wealthier groups if not carefully managed. The **framing of scenarios** is critical; a question about paying for cancer treatment may elicit higher WTP than one about routine screenings due to perceived urgency. **Cultural attitudes** in Malaysia’s multicultural society may prioritize communal health benefits, influencing WTP for UHC programs. **Public funding awareness** can also temper WTP, as respondents may expect subsidized healthcare, reducing their stated willingness to pay out-of-pocket. These factors necessitate rigorous survey design to ensure WTP reflects true societal preferences, avoiding biases that could misguide policy.

### Simplified DCE Example 🎲

**Scenario**: Choosing between two hypothetical **cancer screening programs** with three attributes:

- **Effectiveness**: % reduction in cancer death.
- **Side Effects**: Temporary nausea.
- **Out-of-Pocket Cost**: RM.

The following table presents the options:

|**Attribute**|**Option A**|**Option B**|
|---|---|---|
|**Effectiveness**|60% reduction in mortality|40% reduction in mortality|
|**Side Effects**|Mild nausea for 1 day|No side effects|
|**Cost**|RM 200|RM 50|

**Question**: Which option would you choose?

**Analysis**: If respondents choose **Option A** despite the higher cost, they value **effectiveness** over cost. Using regression models (e.g., **conditional logit**), we can estimate:

- WTP per 1% reduction in mortality.
- WTP per QALY (with assumptions about utility and life-years).

**Conclusion**: DCEs quantify **trade-offs**, helping infer **real-world WTP values** by analyzing how individuals prioritize attributes like effectiveness, side effects, and cost.

**Elaboration**: This simplified DCE illustrates how individuals make trade-offs in healthcare decisions. If many respondents choose **Option A**, it suggests a higher WTP for a 20% improvement in mortality reduction, despite mild side effects and a higher cost. The use of **conditional logit models** allows analysts to quantify the value placed on each attribute (e.g., RM per 1% mortality reduction), which can be translated into WTP per QALY with assumptions about health utility and life expectancy. In a Malaysian context, such experiments could inform policies like cancer screening programs under UHC, ensuring that public preferences guide resource allocation. The **conclusion** emphasizes DCEs’ ability to capture nuanced trade-offs, making them a powerful tool for setting WTP thresholds that reflect societal values.

## 9. Ethical and Equity Implications of WTP ⚖️

Economic evaluations based on **Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)** and **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs)** prioritize **efficiency**, aiming to maximize health gain per ringgit spent. However, real-world health policy decisions often extend beyond efficiency to incorporate **equity** and **ethical considerations**, ensuring that healthcare resources are distributed fairly and align with societal values. This section explores the tension between efficiency and equity, poses critical ethical questions, and examines scenarios where policymakers may deviate from strict ICER-based decisions. By understanding these implications, students can appreciate the moral complexities of health policy and the need to balance economic rigor with fairness and societal priorities.

### The Efficiency vs. Equity Dilemma 🤔

- **Efficiency**: Focuses on **cost-effectiveness** and **resource allocation**, prioritizing interventions that deliver the greatest health benefits for the least cost, as measured by ICERs compared to WTP thresholds.
- **Equity**: Ensures **fair access**, especially for **vulnerable or marginalized groups**, such as low-income populations, rural communities, or those with rare diseases.
- **Challenge**: Balancing efficiency with fairness in **resource-constrained settings**, where prioritizing cost-effective interventions may inadvertently exclude disadvantaged groups or those with high-cost needs.

**Elaboration**: The **efficiency vs. equity dilemma** is a central challenge in health policy. Efficiency-driven evaluations, rooted in WTP and ICERs, aim to optimize health outcomes within budget constraints, often favoring interventions with low ICERs. However, this approach can exacerbate inequities if it overlooks groups with limited access to care or conditions requiring expensive treatments, such as rare diseases. In resource-constrained settings like Malaysia’s public healthcare system, policymakers must navigate this tension, ensuring that efficiency does not come at the expense of fairness. For example, a highly cost-effective intervention may primarily benefit urban populations, leaving rural communities underserved, thus raising ethical concerns about equitable access.

### Ethical Questions to Consider ❓

To address the broader implications of WTP and ICERs, policymakers must grapple with several ethical questions:

1. **Should rare diseases or end-of-life care have higher WTP thresholds?**
    - These conditions often have high ICERs due to costly treatments or limited patient populations, prompting debate about whether societal values justify higher thresholds.
2. **Do we value a QALY for a child more than an adult?**
    - Children may be prioritized due to their potential for longer life expectancy, raising questions about how to weigh QALYs across age groups.
3. **Is it fair if the rich can “afford” more health than the poor?**
    - WTP estimates may reflect income disparities, potentially favoring interventions accessible to wealthier groups, which challenges the principle of equitable healthcare.

These questions highlight the moral complexities of applying WTP in policy. For **rare diseases** or **end-of-life care**, higher WTP thresholds may be justified by societal values like compassion or the need to address unmet medical needs, even if ICERs are unfavorable. The question about **QALY valuation** for children versus adults touches on societal priorities, as investing in pediatric care may yield long-term benefits but compete with immediate needs of other groups. The issue of **income disparities** is particularly relevant in Malaysia, where socioeconomic inequalities could skew WTP estimates, potentially prioritizing interventions that benefit wealthier populations. These questions require policymakers to integrate ethical reasoning with economic data, ensuring decisions reflect both efficiency and fairness.

### When Policymakers Deviate from ICER Rules 🚫

Policymakers may prioritize interventions despite high ICERs due to **ethical or societal values**, recognizing that cost-effectiveness is not the sole determinant of funding decisions. The following table outlines common scenarios and justifications for such deviations:

|**Scenario**|**Common Justification**|
|---|---|
|**End-of-Life Care**|Societal duty to support **dignity**, even if cost is high, reflecting a commitment to compassionate care.|
|**Rare Diseases/Orphan Drugs**|High cost per QALY, but **high unmet need**, as these conditions often lack alternative treatments.|
|**Marginalized Populations**|Priority to **reduce health inequities**, ensuring access for underserved groups like rural or low-income communities.|
|**Childhood Interventions**|**Perceived lifetime benefit** or **moral imperative**, as investing in children may yield long-term societal gains.|

**Example Dilemma**: Two interventions with the same ICER—one saves lives in **poor rural communities**, the other slightly extends life for the **wealthy**. Which would you fund, and why?  
**Key Insight**: **Cost-effectiveness is essential, but fairness, need, and transparency** also matter in real-world decisions, requiring policymakers to weigh societal values alongside economic metrics.

The table illustrates scenarios where **ethical and societal considerations** override strict adherence to ICERs. For **end-of-life care**, society may value providing comfort and dignity, justifying higher costs despite unfavorable ICERs. **Rare diseases** and **orphan drugs** often have high ICERs due to small patient populations, but their unmet needs drive prioritization, as seen in policies supporting specialized treatments. **Marginalized populations** are prioritized to address health disparities, a key concern in Malaysia’s diverse society. **Childhood interventions** are often favored due to their long-term benefits, reflecting a moral commitment to future generations. The **example dilemma** challenges students to articulate their rationale, considering whether equity (favoring rural communities) or efficiency (maximizing health gains) should take precedence. This underscores the **key insight** that cost-effectiveness must be balanced with fairness, need, and transparency, ensuring that policies reflect societal values and promote equitable healthcare access.

## 10. Bringing It All Together: Decision Frameworks 🧠

Economic evaluation is a **tool, not the whole answer**, providing critical evidence but requiring integration with broader considerations to inform health policy decisions. While tools like **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs)** and **Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)** thresholds offer quantitative insights, real-world policy-making demands a holistic approach that accounts for ethical, practical, and societal factors. **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** is a structured framework that combines evidence with values and constraints, enabling policymakers to make informed, balanced decisions. This section explores MCDA’s role in health policy, illustrating how it synthesizes diverse criteria through a practical example, equipping students to navigate the complexities of policy-making with rigor and nuance.

### Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) 📊

**Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** combines evidence with values and constraints, **scoring and weighting criteria** to inform decisions. It provides a systematic approach to evaluate interventions by considering multiple dimensions beyond cost-effectiveness, ensuring that policies reflect both economic and societal priorities. The following table outlines key criteria and their associated considerations:

|**Criterion**|**Example Considerations**|
|---|---|
|**Cost-Effectiveness**|ICER vs. WTP threshold: Does the intervention’s ICER fall below the acceptable cost per QALY or DALY averted?|
|**Budget Impact**|Can the system afford this intervention? What is the total financial burden when scaled to the target population?|
|**Equity**|Will it reduce disparities? Reach marginalized groups, such as rural communities or low-income populations?|
|**Severity of Disease**|Is it life-threatening or high burden? Does the intervention address critical public health needs?|
|**Feasibility of Delivery**|Infrastructure, training, supply chain: Are the necessary resources and systems in place for implementation?|
|**Public/Political Support**|Acceptability and urgency for implementation: Is there stakeholder buy-in or public demand for the intervention?|

MCDA is a powerful tool for navigating the "messy, complex world of policy" by integrating diverse factors into a cohesive decision-making framework. **Cost-effectiveness**, measured by comparing ICERs to WTP thresholds, ensures economic efficiency, but **budget impact** assesses affordability at scale, preventing fiscal overstretch. **Equity** prioritizes fairness, ensuring that interventions benefit underserved groups, a key concern in Malaysia’s diverse society. **Severity of disease** weighs the urgency of health needs, while **feasibility of delivery** addresses practical constraints like infrastructure or workforce capacity. **Public/political support** ensures that interventions are viable in the eyes of stakeholders and the public, enhancing their likelihood of successful implementation. By scoring and weighting these criteria, MCDA provides a transparent, evidence-based approach to prioritize interventions, balancing quantitative data with qualitative values.

### Simplified MCDA Scoring Table 📊

To illustrate MCDA in practice, the following table evaluates three interventions—**HPV Self-Sampling**, **Stroke Rehab**, and **Diabetes Screen**—based on the criteria above, using a simplified scoring system:

|**Intervention**|**ICER**|**Budget Impact**|**Equity Benefit**|**Feasibility**|**Total Score**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**HPV Self-Sampling**|✅ Strong|⚠️ Moderate|✅ Strong|✅ Strong|High|
|**Stroke Rehab**|⚠️ Moderate|✅ Strong|⚠️ Moderate|⚠️ Moderate|Moderate|
|**Diabetes Screen**|✅ Strong|❌ Weak|✅ Strong|⚠️ Moderate|Moderate|

- **Legend**: ✅ = Strong, ⚠️ = Moderate, ❌ = Weak.
- **Conclusion**: **Good policy needs evidence, ethics, and economics**. MCDA helps combine these elements systematically, ensuring that decisions are transparent, balanced, and aligned with societal goals.

The scoring table demonstrates how MCDA synthesizes multiple criteria to guide policy decisions. **HPV Self-Sampling** scores highly due to its favorable ICER, strong equity benefits (targeting women’s health), and feasible implementation, despite a moderate budget impact. **Stroke Rehab** benefits from a low budget impact but is hindered by a less favorable ICER and moderate equity and feasibility scores, resulting in a moderate overall score. **Diabetes Screen** has a strong ICER and equity benefit but is constrained by a high budget impact, leading to a moderate score. The **legend** clarifies the scoring system, where ✅ indicates a strong performance, ⚠️ suggests moderate challenges, and ❌ highlights significant weaknesses. The **conclusion** emphasizes that **good policy** integrates **evidence** (e.g., ICERs), **ethics** (e.g., equity), and **economics** (e.g., budget impact), with MCDA providing a structured method to weigh these factors. In Malaysia’s context, MCDA could guide decisions on UHC benefit packages, ensuring that interventions like HPV screening are prioritized for their broad societal impact.

## 13. Key Takeaways for Future Health Leaders 🌟

As **future health leaders**, your role extends beyond analyzing data to **informing action** that shapes healthcare systems and improves lives. These takeaways empower students to move beyond theoretical analysis, ensuring that their work influences **access, funding, and system evolution** in contexts like Malaysia’s public healthcare system.

### Critical Lessons for Health Policy Leadership 📋


1. **ICER ≠ Final Answer**: **Context, budget, equity, and feasibility** are equally important.
    
    - The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** is a vital metric for assessing cost-effectiveness, but it is not the sole determinant of policy decisions.
    - Policymakers must consider **context** (e.g., local epidemiology), **budget constraints**, **equity** (e.g., benefits for marginalized groups), and **feasibility** (e.g., infrastructure readiness) to ensure decisions are practical and fair.
    - **Elaboration**: While ICERs provide a quantitative basis for comparing interventions, their interpretation requires a holistic view. For example, an intervention with a low ICER may be unaffordable if its budget impact exceeds fiscal capacity, as seen in Malaysia’s resource-constrained health system. Similarly, prioritizing equity might justify funding a higher-ICER intervention that serves rural communities, ensuring fairness over pure efficiency.
2. **DRG/Case-Mix Costing**: A **scalable, policy-relevant approach** for national financing and Health Technology Assessments (HTAs).
    
    - **Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG)/case-mix costing** standardizes cost estimates by classifying patients into groups with similar resource use, facilitating budgeting and reimbursement.
    - It supports **national financing strategies** and HTAs, such as Malaysia’s MaHTAS evaluations, by providing scalable cost data.
    - **Elaboration**: DRG’s scalability makes it ideal for large-scale policy applications, such as setting hospital tariffs or evaluating UHC programs. In Malaysia, the use of the UNU-CBG Grouper for DRG coding enhances cost generalizability, but challenges like outdated IT systems highlight the need for infrastructure investment. This approach ensures that clinical data informs national financing, aligning patient care with policy goals.
3. **WTP**: Can be derived from **public preferences**, not just GDP-based thresholds.
    
    - **Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)** thresholds can be informed by methods like Contingent Valuation (CV) or Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE), capturing societal values rather than relying solely on economic metrics like 1–3× GDP per capita.
    - **Elaboration**: Public preference-based WTP thresholds, derived from surveys, reflect societal priorities, such as valuing life-saving treatments over preventive measures. In Malaysia, incorporating local preferences (e.g., via Malaysian EQ-5D tariffs) ensures that thresholds align with cultural and economic contexts, making policies more relevant and acceptable to the population.
4. **Policy-Relevant EEs**: Must address **real decisions and real people**, using local data and clear communication.
    
    - Effective EEs are **timely**, **context-specific**, and **actionable**, using local data (e.g., Malaysian pricing, epidemiology) and presenting findings in stakeholder-friendly formats.
    - **Elaboration**: Policy-relevant EEs go beyond academic rigor to address urgent questions, such as which interventions to include in Malaysia’s UHC benefit package. By using local data and clear visuals, they ensure that policymakers, clinicians, and the public understand the implications, fostering trust and facilitating implementation. This approach ensures that EEs directly influence real-world decisions, impacting patient access and system priorities.
5. **Impact of EEs**: The best economic evaluations **shape access, funding, and system evolution**, not just sit in reports.
    
    - EEs should drive tangible outcomes, influencing **who gets access** to care, **what gets funded**, and **how health systems evolve** to meet population needs.
    - **Elaboration**: The ultimate goal of EEs is to transform health systems by informing resource allocation and policy design. For example, a well-crafted EE might justify funding for a new cancer screening program in Malaysia, improving access for underserved women and reshaping public health priorities. By focusing on actionable outcomes, EEs become catalysts for systemic change, ensuring that health systems are equitable, efficient, and responsive to societal needs.

**Reflection on Broader Impact**: These takeaways collectively empower future health leaders to bridge the gap between analysis and action. By recognizing that **ICERs are not the final answer**, students learn to integrate economic evidence with practical and ethical considerations, ensuring that policies are feasible and fair. **DRG/case-mix costing** and **WTP** provide tools to align evaluations with national priorities, while **policy-relevant EEs** ensure that findings are actionable in local contexts. The emphasis on **impact** underscores the role of health leaders in driving systemic change, making healthcare more accessible and sustainable. In Malaysia, where resource constraints and diverse population needs pose challenges, these lessons are critical for shaping a health system that balances efficiency with equity.

## Short-Essay Questions

These questions require students to **apply concepts** to practical scenarios, demonstrating **conceptual understanding** and **problem-solving skills** (150–200 words each).

### Question 1: Market Failures in Malaysia’s Healthcare System

**Question**: Discuss two types of market failures in Malaysia’s private healthcare sector and how government intervention, such as the separation of prescribing and dispensing policy, addresses them. (HE 1, Section 2; HE 7, Section 2)

**Answer**:

#### Understanding Market Failures

**Market failures** occur when healthcare markets fail to allocate resources efficiently, necessitating **government intervention** (HE 1, Section 2). In Malaysia’s private sector, **information asymmetry** and **provider-induced demand** are prevalent, inflating costs and undermining **equity** (HE 7, Section 2).

#### Market Failures in Malaysia’s Private Sector

- **Information Asymmetry**: Patients lack medical knowledge, relying on providers who may over-prescribe for profit, increasing costs in Malaysia’s private sector, where 40% of outpatient visits occur (HE 3, Section 5). This exacerbates **OOP expenditure** (31.5% of THE, HE 4, Section 9), limiting access for low-income groups (HE 6, Section 2).
- **Provider-Induced Demand**: Physicians in private clinics may prescribe unnecessary drugs or tests, inflating costs and risking patient safety, as seen in Malaysia’s high private sector expenditure (HE 7, Section 2).

#### Government Intervention: Separation Policy

The **separation of prescribing and dispensing policy** addresses these failures by requiring prescriptions to be filled at pharmacies, reducing physicians’ financial incentives to over-prescribe (HE 7, Section 2). This promotes **cost control** and **patient safety**, aligning with **UHC** goals (HE 5, Section 9). However, **rural access** to pharmacies remains a challenge, requiring further infrastructure support (HE 6, Section 2).

#### Policy Implications

This intervention enhances **transparency** and **equity**, reducing **OOP burdens** and ensuring fairer access, critical for Malaysia’s health system (HE 4, Section 9).

These questions require **in-depth analysis** (500–600 words), encouraging **critical thinking**, **synthesis**, and **policy recommendations** with **Malaysia-specific** and **global applications**.

### Question 1: Balancing Efficiency and Equity in Malaysia’s UHC

**Question**: Discuss how economic evaluations (HE 9–HE 12) can balance **efficiency** and **equity** in Malaysia’s pursuit of UHC. Analyze the role of **ICER**, **WTP thresholds**, and **MCDA** in prioritizing interventions like Peka B40. Propose a framework to address rural-urban disparities, drawing on global examples (e.g., Thailand’s HITAP). (HE 6, Section 2; HE 12, Sections 4, 10)

**Answer**:

#### Introduction

**Economic evaluations** (HE 9–HE 12) are pivotal in balancing **efficiency** (maximizing health gains per resource) and **equity** (ensuring fair access) in Malaysia’s pursuit of **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)**. Malaysia’s dual healthcare system, with **RM 78.2 billion THE** (5.1% GDP, 31.5% OOP in 2021), faces **rural-urban disparities** (e.g., higher rural IMRs, HE 6, Section 2). Tools like **ICER**, **WTP thresholds**, and **MCDA** guide prioritization of interventions like **Peka B40**, ensuring **cost-effectiveness** and **equity** (HE 12, Sections 4, 10).

#### Role of ICER

The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, calculated as:  
$$\text{ICER}=\frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{new}}-\text{Cost}_{\text{comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{new}}-\text{Effect}_{\text{comparator}}}$$  
quantifies **cost-effectiveness** (HE 9, Section 4). For **Peka B40** interventions (e.g., diabetes screening), a low ICER (e.g., RM 95,000/QALY) below Malaysia’s **WTP threshold** (RM 120,000/QALY) ensures **efficiency** (HE 12, Section 4). However, **budget impact** (e.g., RM 200 million for 1.5 million adults) must align with **fiscal space**, avoiding displacement of other services (HE 12, Section 6).

#### Role of WTP Thresholds

**WTP thresholds**, derived from 1–3× GDP per capita (RM 48,000–144,000) or surveys (e.g., **Contingent Valuation**, **DCE**), reflect societal valuation of health gains (HE 12, Section 4). For **Peka B40**, thresholds prioritize interventions addressing **non-communicable diseases**, but **equity** considerations may justify higher ICERs for rural populations, reducing **OOP burdens** (31.5% of THE, HE 4, Section 9).

#### Role of MCDA

**Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** integrates **cost-effectiveness**, **equity**, and **feasibility** (HE 12, Section 10). For **Peka B40**, MCDA scores:

- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Strong for low ICERs.
- **Equity**: Strong for targeting B40 groups.
- **Feasibility**: Moderate due to infrastructure needs.  
    This ensures **transparent decisions**, balancing efficiency with fairness (HE 6, Section 2).

#### Proposed Framework for Rural-Urban Disparities

A framework to address **rural-urban disparities** includes:

**Answer**:

#### Introduction

**Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG)/case-mix costing** standardizes costs by classifying patients into groups with similar resource use, supporting Malaysia’s **health financing reforms** (HE 12, Section 7). It enhances **UHC** and **HTA**, but faces challenges like **IT infrastructure** and **data dependency**.

#### Role in Health Financing

**DRG** calculates costs using:  
$$\text{BR}_t=\frac{\text{HP}_t}{\text{Cases}_{h,t-1}}$$  
multiplied by **cost weights**, ensuring **scalable budgeting** (HE 12, Section 7). In Malaysia’s **MOH** and university hospitals, the **UNU-CBG Grouper** supports **hospital budgeting**, aligning costs with clinical needs.

#### Support for UHC and HTA

- **UHC**: Reduces **OOP burdens** (31.5% of THE, HE 4, Section 9) by standardizing payments, enhancing **equity** (HE 6, Section 2).
- **HTA**: Provides **MaHTAS** with standardized cost inputs, improving **cost-effectiveness** assessments (HE 12, Section 7).

#### Malaysian Example: Hospital Budgeting

For a hospital with a RM 500 million budget and 100,000 cases, **DRG** assigns costs (e.g., RM 8,500 for stroke, HE 12, Section 7), supporting **efficient resource allocation**.

#### Challenges

- **IT Infrastructure**: Irregular systems hinder **DRG coding**, requiring digital upgrades (HE 12, Section 7).
- **Data Dependency**: Relies on accurate clinical data, challenging in rural areas (HE 6, Section 2).
