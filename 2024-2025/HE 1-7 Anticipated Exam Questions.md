## üìä Problem-Based Questions (Application and Quantitative Analysis)
These questions require calculations or data interpretation, testing analytical skills (5‚Äì10 marks each).

6. **Using the demand schedule for ice cream cones from HE 2, calculate the Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) when the price increases from RM 1.50 to RM 2.00. Is the demand elastic or inelastic? Discuss the implications for pricing healthcare services in Malaysia.**  
   - *Data*:  

| **Price (RM)** | **Quantity Demanded** |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| 1.50          | 60                    |
| 2.00          | 40                    |
 
   - *Formula*: $\text{PED} = \frac{\% \Delta Q_d}{\% \Delta P}$.
   - *Hint*: Compare with Malaysia‚Äôs outpatient care PED (-0.04, Heller, 1975).

7. **In the Malaysia National Health Accounts (2021), OOP payments accounted for 31.5% of Total Health Expenditure (THE) of RM 78.2 billion. Calculate the absolute OOP amount and discuss how high OOP reliance impacts equity in Malaysia‚Äôs healthcare system.**  
   - *Hint*: Reference HE 4 and HE 5 on catastrophic payments and poverty impact.

8. **Based on the Rand Health Insurance Experiments (HE 2), the free plan had a likelihood of any medical use of 86.7%, while the 95% cost-sharing plan had 68.0%. Calculate the percentage reduction in likelihood and explain how cost-sharing affects healthcare utilization in a Malaysian context.**  
   - *Hint*: Use data from HE 2 and Malaysia‚Äôs subsidized public care (HE 3).

9. **Suppose a Malaysian private GP clinic operates under a fee-for-service payment model. If the clinic charges RM 50 per consultation and sees 100 patients monthly, calculate the revenue. Discuss how switching to a capitation model (RM 600 per patient per year for 100 patients) would affect revenue and provider behavior.**  
   - *Hint*: Reference HE 3 on payment mechanisms and provider-induced demand.

10. **Using the global poor-rich infant mortality gap data from HE 6, calculate the percentage of infant deaths that would remain if intra-country disparities were eliminated. Discuss how Malaysia could address its rural-urban infant mortality gap.**  
    - *Data*: Global gap = 4.91 million; Intra-country gap = 3.11 million.
    - *Hint*: Use HE 6 calculation: $ \frac{3.11}{4.91} \times 100 = 63\% $.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Essay Questions (Critical Analysis and Policy Application)
These questions require in-depth analysis, synthesis, and policy recommendations, suitable for MPH-level critical thinking (10‚Äì15 marks each).

11. **Critically evaluate the merits and challenges of implementing a policy to separate drug prescribing and dispensing in Malaysia‚Äôs private GP practices. How would this policy impact healthcare equity and provider behavior in rural areas?**  
    - *Hint*: Draw on HE 7‚Äôs policy discussion, considering **provider-induced demand**, **patient safety**, **rural access**, and **GP revenue**.

12. **Discuss how the Grossman‚Äôs Theory of Health Demand (1972) explains the relationship between health and healthcare demand. Using Malaysia‚Äôs National Health and Morbidity Survey (1996) findings, analyze how income and age influence healthcare utilization.**  
    - *Hint*: Reference HE 3‚Äôs Grossman model and Rozita et al.‚Äôs U-shaped age demand pattern.

13. **Compare and contrast Social Health Insurance (SHI) and Private Health Insurance (PHI) in terms of their objectives, premium setting, and impact on equity. Propose how Malaysia could integrate SHI to advance Universal Health Coverage (UHC).**  
    - *Hint*: Use HE 5‚Äôs SHI vs. PHI comparison and Malaysia‚Äôs current financing mix (HE 4).

14. **Analyze the role of market failures in justifying government intervention in Malaysia‚Äôs health sector. Using examples from public and merit goods, explain how government policies address these failures to promote equity.**  
    - *Hint*: Reference HE 7‚Äôs market failures (e.g., vaccines, health information) and Malaysia‚Äôs public healthcare system.

15. **Evaluate the ethical implications of utilitarianism, liberalism, and communitarianism in shaping health policies to reduce inequities in Malaysia. Which framework best aligns with Malaysia‚Äôs dual healthcare system, and why?**  
    - *Hint*: Draw on HE 6‚Äôs ethical theories and Malaysia‚Äôs public-private healthcare dynamics (HE 3, HE 4).

## üìã Case Study Questions (Real-World Application)
These questions integrate multiple lectures, requiring students to apply concepts to practical scenarios (10‚Äì15 marks each).

16. **Case Study: Rural Healthcare Access in Malaysia**  
    - **Scenario**: A rural district in Malaysia has high infant mortality rates (IMR = 10 per 1,000 live births) compared to urban areas (IMR = 5). The district relies heavily on OOP payments (40% of health expenditure) and has limited pharmacies.
