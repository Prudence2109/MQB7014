## 📚 Overview of Health Economics (HE 1)

**HE 1: Introduction and Course Overview** establishes the foundation for understanding health economics as the study of **resource allocation** under **scarcity** in healthcare systems. It outlines the course structure, emphasizing **rational decision-making**, **opportunity costs**, and **marginal analysis** as core tools for analyzing health policy and practice.

- **Key Insights**:
  - **Health Economics**: Analyzes how **scarce resources** are allocated to meet **health needs**, balancing **efficiency** and **equity** 🩺.
  - **Scarcity Principle**: Limited resources force **trade-offs**, where choosing one option means forgoing another (e.g., healthcare vs. education funding) 📉.
  - **Rational Decision-Making**: Individuals maximize **utility** (satisfaction) by weighing **costs** (including **opportunity costs**) against **benefits**, often at the **margins** 🧠.
  - **Malaysia Context (2023)**: Health expenditure at **4.41% of GDP**, with **public sector** dominating outpatient care (18.96M visits) and **respiratory diseases** as the leading cause of hospitalization 🇲🇾.
  - **Course Structure**: Combines **lectures**, a **mid-semester test** (HE 2–7), a **group assignment** (Modified Gallery Walk), and a **final exam**, fostering **inquiry** and **collaboration** 📅.
- **Key Terminologies**:
  - **Scarcity**: Condition where resources cannot meet unlimited wants, necessitating **choices** and **sacrifices**.
  - **Utility**: Satisfaction or benefit from consuming goods/services, measured by **price paid** as a proxy.
  - **Opportunity Cost**: Value of the **next best alternative** forgone when making a choice.
  - **Marginal Analysis**: Decision-making based on **incremental costs** and **benefits** of additional units.
  - **Rational Person**: An individual who maximizes **utility** within constraints, guided by **cost-benefit analysis** ($\text{Benefits} \geq \text{Costs}$).

## 📈 Economic Tools for Health Analysis (HE 2)

**HE 2: Basic Economic Tools** introduces analytical frameworks such as **supply and demand**, **elasticity**, and **market structures**, with applications to healthcare markets. It emphasizes how **price changes** and **non-price factors** influence healthcare utilization.

- **Key Insights**:
  - **Law of Demand**: *When price falls, quantity demanded rises, ceteris paribus* 📉.
  - **Law of Supply**: *When price rises, quantity supplied rises* 📈.
  - **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**: Measures responsiveness of demand to price changes, critical for pricing policies ($\text{PED} = \frac{\% \Delta Q_d}{\% \Delta P}$). Healthcare demand is often **inelastic** (e.g., PED = -0.04 in Malaysia, 1975) 🩺.
  - **Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED)**: Assesses demand shifts due to price changes in related goods (e.g., public vs. private care in Malaysia, CED = +0.15) 🔄.
  - **Perfect Competition**: Ideal market with **many firms**, **identical products**, **free entry/exit**, and **perfect information**, ensuring **efficiency** but rare in healthcare 🏪.
  - **Empirical Evidence**:  
    - **Rand Experiments (1971–1982)**: Cost-sharing reduced utilization without compromising quality.
    - **Madagascar Study (2017)**: Fee exemptions increased healthcare use by 65%, highlighting **access barriers** 💉.
- **Key Terminologies**:
  - **Demand**: Amount consumers are **willing and able** to buy at a given price.
  - **Supply**: Amount producers are **willing and able** to sell at a given price.
  - **Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)**: Responsiveness of quantity demanded to price changes.
  - **Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED)**: Responsiveness of one good’s demand to another’s price change ($\text{CED}_{AB} = \frac{\% \Delta Q_A}{\% \Delta P_B}$).
  - **Market Equilibrium**: Point where **quantity demanded equals quantity supplied** ($Q_d = Q_s$).
  - **Perfect Competition**: Market structure maximizing **efficiency** with no single firm controlling prices.
