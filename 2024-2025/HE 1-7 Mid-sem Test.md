These questions test **conceptual understanding** of key economic principles, financing mechanisms, equity challenges, and government roles in healthcare, as presented in the lectures **Demand for Health and Healthcare (HE 2)**, **Supply of Health Services (HE 3)**, **Financing Health Care (HE 4)**, **Health Insurance and Managed Care (HE 5)**, **Equality, Equity, and Social Justice (HE 6)**, and **Government‚Äôs Role in the Health Sector (HE 7)**. Each question is crafted to assess **theoretical knowledge**, **application** to real-world contexts (especially Malaysia), and **clarity of expression**, with **answer guides** and **marking criteria** provided for precision. 

### HE 2: Demand for Health and Healthcare

1. **Explain the concept of derived demand in healthcare and provide a Malaysia-specific example to illustrate it.**  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Derived Demand**: The demand for healthcare is **derived** from the demand for **health**, which individuals seek for **utility** (e.g., ability to work or enjoy life). People demand healthcare services (e.g., doctor visits, medications) as a means to achieve or maintain health, not for the services themselves (HE 2, Slide 9).  
   - **Malaysia Example**: A factory worker in Malaysia seeks **antibiotic treatment** for an infection to restore health and return to work, demonstrating that the demand for antibiotics is derived from the need for health to maintain productivity (Slide 9).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Definition of derived demand (2 marks), Malaysia-specific example with explanation (2 marks), clarity and conciseness (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

2. **Define price elasticity of demand and explain how it affects healthcare utilization in Malaysia.**  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Price Elasticity**: Measures the responsiveness of demand to price changes, calculated as $\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \Delta Q}{\%\ \Delta P}$, where $Q$ is quantity demanded and $P$ is price. High elasticity means demand decreases significantly with price increases (HE 2, Slide 12).  
   - **Impact in Malaysia**: In Malaysia‚Äôs private sector, high **price elasticity** for non-essential services (e.g., elective surgeries) means that price increases reduce utilization, particularly among low-income patients, limiting access to care (Slide 12).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Definition with formula (2 marks), explanation of impact in Malaysia (2 marks), clarity and conciseness (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

### HE 3: Supply of Health Services

3. **Describe the concept of supplier-induced demand and its implications for healthcare costs in Malaysia.**  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Supplier-Induced Demand**: Occurs when providers (e.g., doctors) influence patients to demand more services than needed, often due to **financial incentives** in **fee-for-service** models, leveraging **information asymmetry** (HE 3, Slide 18).  
   - **Implications in Malaysia**: In Malaysia‚Äôs private GP practices, doctors may prescribe **unnecessary tests** or medications to increase revenue, inflating **healthcare costs** and potentially compromising patient care quality (Slide 18).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Definition of supplier-induced demand (2 marks), implications for Malaysia‚Äôs costs (2 marks), clarity and conciseness (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

4. **Explain how economies of scale affect the supply of healthcare services, with a Malaysia-specific example.**  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Economies of Scale**: Reduced average costs ($AC = \frac{TC}{Q}$) as production scales, where $TC$ is total cost and $Q$ is quantity, due to spreading fixed costs over more output (HE 3, Slide 12).  
   - **Malaysia Example**: Large private hospital chains in Malaysia, like **KPJ Healthcare**, achieve **economies of scale** by centralizing diagnostic equipment and staff, lowering per-patient costs compared to small clinics (Slide 12).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Definition with cost explanation (2 marks), Malaysia-specific example (2 marks), clarity and conciseness (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

### HE 4: Financing Health Care

5. **Define financial protection in the context of health financing and explain its importance for Universal Health Coverage (UHC).**  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Financial Protection**: Ensures healthcare costs do not cause **financial hardship** or threaten living standards, achieved through **prepayment** and **risk pooling** (e.g., taxation, insurance) (HE 4, Slide 8).  
   - **Importance for UHC**: **Financial protection** is a pillar of UHC, enabling **equitable access** to services without catastrophic payments, ensuring all can use needed care regardless of income, as seen in Malaysia‚Äôs subsidized public clinics (Slide 8).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Definition of financial protection (2 marks), importance for UHC (2 marks), clarity and conciseness (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

6. **Explain the role of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) in comparing health expenditures across countries, using a Malaysia-specific example.**  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)**: Adjusts expenditures to reflect **real purchasing power** across countries, accounting for differences in what a currency can buy, calculated as $\text{PPP} = \frac{\text{Cost in Local Currency}}{\text{Exchange Rate}}$ (HE 4, Slide 27).  
   - **Malaysia Example**: Malaysia‚Äôs per capita Current Health Expenditure (CHE) in 2022 was **$458 USD** at exchange rates but **$1,281 USD** at PPP, showing higher real spending power for healthcare compared to nominal figures (Slide 26).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Definition with PPP explanation (2 marks), Malaysia-specific example (2 marks), clarity and conciseness (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

### HE 5: Health Insurance and Managed Care

7. **Define moral hazard in health insurance and explain how it impacts healthcare utilization in Malaysia.**  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Moral Hazard**: Occurs when insured individuals **overuse services** due to reduced financial risk, as insurance lowers out-of-pocket costs (HE 5, Slide 43).  
   - **Impact in Malaysia**: Under corporate insurance plans in Malaysia, patients may seek **unnecessary consultations** or tests, increasing **healthcare utilization** and costs, straining private sector resources (Slide 43).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Definition of moral hazard (2 marks), impact in Malaysia (2 marks), clarity and conciseness (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

8. **Explain the difference between community-rated and risk-rated premiums in health insurance, with a Malaysia-specific context.**  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Community-Rated Premiums**: Same rates for all insured, based on average community risk, promoting **equity** (e.g., social health insurance, SHI) (HE 5, Slide 27).  
   - **Risk-Rated Premiums**: Vary by individual risk (e.g., age, health status), used in private health insurance (PHI), risking **exclusion** of high-risk groups (HE 5, Slide 26).  
   - **Malaysia Context**: A proposed **SHI** in Malaysia would use **community-rated premiums** to cover all, unlike **PHI‚Äôs risk-rated premiums**, which exclude low-income or high-risk individuals (Slide 29).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Community-rated definition (1 mark), risk-rated definition (1 mark), Malaysia context (2 marks), clarity (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

### HE 6: Equality, Equity, and Social Justice

9. **Define the Inverse Care Law and explain its relevance to health equity in Malaysia.**  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Inverse Care Law**: *‚ÄúThe availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the population served‚Äù* (Hart, 1971), meaning wealthier groups access better care despite lower needs (HE 6, Slide 27).  
   - **Relevance in Malaysia**: In Malaysia, urban elites access **private hospitals** with advanced care, while rural poor rely on under-resourced **public clinics**, exacerbating **health inequities** like higher rural infant mortality (Slide 22).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Definition of Inverse Care Law (2 marks), relevance to Malaysia‚Äôs equity (2 marks), clarity and conciseness (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

10. **Explain the concept of social determinants of health (SDH) and their role in driving health inequities, with a Malaysia-specific example.**  
    **Answer Guide**:  
    - **Social Determinants of Health (SDH)**: Social and economic structures (e.g., education, sanitation, income) shaping health outcomes, beyond individual behaviors (HE 6, Slide 56).  
    - **Role in Inequities**: SDH create **systemic barriers** (e.g., poverty, lack of infrastructure), leading to disparities like higher disease prevalence among the poor (Slide 56).  
    - **Malaysia Example**: Limited **sanitation** in rural Malaysia increases **diarrhea incidence**, an inequity driven by poor living conditions, compared to urban areas (Slide 22).  
    **Marking Criteria**: SDH definition (2 marks), role in inequities (1 mark), Malaysia example (1 mark), clarity (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

### HE 7: Government‚Äôs Role in the Health Sector

11. **Define public goods in the context of health and explain why they require government intervention, with a Malaysia-specific example.**  
    **Answer Guide**:  
    - **Public Goods**: Non-rivalrous (one‚Äôs use doesn‚Äôt reduce availability) and non-excludable (cannot prevent access) goods, under-provided by markets due to unprofitability (HE 7, Slide 32).  
    - **Need for Intervention**: Markets fail to supply public goods adequately, as private firms lack incentives, requiring government provision to ensure access (Slide 33).  
    - **Malaysia Example**: The **MySejahtera app**, providing free COVID-19 health updates to all, is a public good funded by the government to bridge information gaps (Slide 33).  
    **Marking Criteria**: Definition of public goods (2 marks), intervention explanation (1 mark), Malaysia example (1 mark), clarity (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

12. **Explain the concept of Pigouvian taxes and their role in addressing market failures in health, with a Malaysia-specific example.**  
    **Answer Guide**:  
    - **Pigouvian Taxes**: Taxes targeting **negative externalities** to align private and social costs, discouraging harmful behaviors (HE 7, Slide 38).  
    - **Role in Market Failures**: By increasing costs of activities with external harms (e.g., pollution), Pigouvian taxes reduce their prevalence, correcting market inefficiencies (Slide 38).  
    - **Malaysia Example**: Malaysia‚Äôs **carbon taxes** on industrial emissions reduce air pollution, a negative externality causing respiratory diseases, improving public health (Slide 38).  
    **Marking Criteria**: Definition of Pigouvian taxes (2 marks), role in market failures (1 mark), Malaysia example (1 mark), clarity (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

## üìä Problem-Based Questions

**Overview**: The following set of **problem-based questions** is designed for the **mid-semester test** (May 22, 2025) of the **MQB7014: Health Economics** module, covering **HE 2‚Äì7** (HE 1, Slide 11). These questions test **application and analytical skills** by presenting **scenarios** that require students to apply concepts from **Demand for Health and Healthcare (HE 2)**, **Supply of Health Services (HE 3)**, **Financing Health Care (HE 4)**, **Health Insurance and Managed Care (HE 5)**, **Equality, Equity, and Social Justice (HE 6)**, and **Government‚Äôs Role in the Health Sector (HE 7)**. Each question includes a **scenario**, a **task**, an **answer guide**, and **marking criteria**, ensuring **rigor** and **relevance** to lecture content. The questions incorporate **Malaysia-specific examples** and **global contexts**.

### HE 2: Demand for Health and Healthcare

1. **Scenario**: In Malaysia, a private hospital increases its consultation fee for general practitioner (GP) visits from RM 50 to RM 60. Historical data shows that the quantity of visits decreases from 1,000 to 900 per month. The hospital estimates that 60% of patients are low-income and highly sensitive to price changes.  
   **Task**: Calculate the **price elasticity of demand** for GP visits and explain how this impacts low-income patients‚Äô access to care in Malaysia.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Calculation**: Price elasticity is $ \text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \Delta Q}{\%\ \Delta P} $, where $ Q $ is quantity demanded and $ P $ is price (HE 2, Slide 12).  
     - **Price change**: From RM 50 to RM 60, $ \Delta P = 60 - 50 = 10 $, so $ \% \Delta P = \frac{10}{50} \times 100 = 20\% $.  
     - **Quantity change**: From 1,000 to 900 visits, $ \Delta Q = 900 - 1,000 = -100 $, so $ \% \Delta Q = \frac{-100}{1,000} \times 100 = -10\% $.  
     - **Elasticity**: $$ \text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{-10\%}{20\%} = -0.5 $$, indicating **inelastic demand** (|0.5| < 1).  
   - **Impact**: The **inelastic demand** (-0.5) suggests a modest reduction in visits (10%) despite a 20% price increase, but **low-income patients** (60% of the cohort) are **highly sensitive** and likely reduce visits more significantly, limiting their **access to care** due to financial constraints, exacerbating health disparities in Malaysia (Slide 12).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Correct elasticity calculation with steps (3 marks), explanation of impact on low-income access (2 marks). **Total: 5 marks**.

2. **Scenario**: A rural Malaysian community has an average household income of RM 2,000 per month. A new private clinic opens, charging RM 100 per consultation. Data suggests that a 10% income increase leads to a 15% increase in healthcare demand in similar communities.  
   **Task**: Calculate the **income elasticity of demand** for healthcare and discuss how income changes affect healthcare utilization in this community.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Calculation**: Income elasticity is $\text{Income Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \Delta Q}{\%\ \Delta I}$, where $Q$ is quantity demanded and $I$ is income (HE 2, Slide 15).  
     - Given: A 10% income increase ($\% \Delta I = 10\%$) leads to a 15% demand increase ($\% \Delta Q = 15\%$).  
     - **Elasticity**: $\text{Income Elasticity} = \frac{15\%}{10\%} = 1.5$, indicating healthcare is a **normal good** with elastic demand (>1).  
   - **Impact**: A **1.5 income elasticity** means demand for healthcare (e.g., clinic visits) rises faster than income. If incomes in this rural community increase (e.g., to RM 2,200), residents are likely to **increase utilization** of the private clinic, improving access but potentially straining budgets due to high costs (RM 100 per visit), highlighting income-related disparities (Slide 15).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Correct elasticity calculation (2 marks), discussion of utilization impact (2 marks), clarity (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

### HE 3: Supply of Health Services

3. **Scenario**: A private hospital in Kuala Lumpur operates under a fee-for-service model, where doctors earn RM 50 per consultation and RM 200 per diagnostic test. The hospital notices a 30% increase in test orders after installing new diagnostic equipment, despite stable patient conditions.  
   **Task**: Explain how **supplier-induced demand** contributes to this increase and propose one strategy to mitigate it in Malaysia‚Äôs private sector.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Supplier-Induced Demand**: Doctors, leveraging **information asymmetry**, encourage more services (e.g., tests) to increase income, especially in **fee-for-service** models, where payments are tied to service volume (HE 3, Slide 18). The 30% increase in tests, despite stable conditions, suggests doctors are inducing demand to recover equipment costs or boost earnings.  
   - **Strategy**: Implement **capitation payments** in Malaysia‚Äôs private hospitals, where doctors receive a fixed amount per patient regardless of services provided, reducing incentives to over-order tests (Slide 18).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Explanation of supplier-induced demand (2 marks), strategy proposal with justification (2 marks), clarity (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

4. **Scenario**: A Malaysian hospital chain plans to merge its three facilities to reduce costs. Currently, each facility serves 10,000 patients annually with a fixed cost of RM 5 million and variable cost of RM 200 per patient. After merging, fixed costs rise to RM 12 million, but variable costs drop to RM 150 per patient for 30,000 patients.  
   **Task**: Calculate the **average cost per patient** before and after the merger to demonstrate economies of scale, and explain the benefit for Malaysia‚Äôs healthcare system.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Economies of Scale**: Reduced average costs ($AC = \frac{TC}{Q}$) as output increases, where $TC$ is total cost and $Q$ is quantity (HE 3, Slide 12).  
   - **Before Merger**:  
     - Total cost per facility: $TC = \text{Fixed Cost} + (\text{Variable Cost} \times Q) = 5,000,000 + (200 \times 10,000) = 7,000,000$.  
     - Average cost: $$ AC = \frac{7,000,000}{10,000} = 700 \, \text{RM/patient} $$.  
     - For three facilities: $ AC = 700 \, \text{RM/patient} $.  
   - **After Merger**:  
     - Total cost: $TC = 12,000,000 + (150 \times 30,000) = 12,000,000 + 4,500,000 = 16,500,000$.  
     - Average cost: $$ AC = \frac{16,500,000}{30,000} = 550 \, \text{RM/patient} $$.  
   - **Benefit**: The **economies of scale** reduce average cost from RM 700 to RM 550 per patient, allowing the hospital to offer **more affordable services** or invest in quality improvements, enhancing **efficiency** in Malaysia‚Äôs private sector (Slide 12).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Correct AC calculations (3 marks), benefit explanation (2 marks). **Total: 5 marks**.

### HE 4: Financing Health Care

5. **Scenario**: In Malaysia (2021), Total Health Expenditure (THE) was RM 78.2 billion, with out-of-pocket (OOP) payments at RM 24.6 billion. A rural household with monthly consumption of RM 3,000 spends RM 400 on healthcare annually.  
   **Task**: Calculate the **OOP share** of THE and determine if the household‚Äôs spending constitutes a **catastrophic health payment**. Discuss the implications for Malaysia‚Äôs UHC goals.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **OOP Share**: OOP share is $\text{OOP Share} = \frac{\text{OOP Expenditure}}{\text{THE}} \times 100$ (HE 4, Slide 68).  
     - Calculation: $$\text{OOP Share} = \frac{24.6}{78.2} \times 100 = 31.5\%$$.  
   - **Catastrophic Health Payment**: Defined as OOP spending >10% of household consumption (HE 4, Slide 8).  
     - Annual consumption: $3,000 \times 12 = 36,000 \, \text{RM}$.  
     - OOP percentage: $\frac{400}{36,000} \times 100 = 1.11\%$, which is **not catastrophic** (<10%).  
   - **Implications**: The **31.5% OOP share** indicates a significant burden, but this household avoids catastrophic payments. High OOP reliance hinders Malaysia‚Äôs **UHC goals**, as poorer households may face financial hardship, necessitating **risk pooling** via taxation or insurance (Slide 8).  
   **Marking Criteria**: OOP share calculation (2 marks), catastrophic payment assessment (2 marks), UHC implications (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

6. **Scenario**: Malaysia‚Äôs Ministry of Health reviews its 2021 financing data: RM 78.2 billion THE, with 31.5% OOP, 13.1% private insurance, and the rest from government taxation. A proposed policy aims to reduce OOP to 20% by increasing tax-funded subsidies.  
   **Task**: Calculate the **current government taxation share** of THE and explain how reducing OOP to 20% could affect equity in Malaysia‚Äôs health system.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Taxation Share**: Total THE = RM 78.2 billion; OOP = 31.5% (RM 24.6 billion); private insurance = 13.1% (RM 10.24 billion) (HE 4, Slide 68).  
     - Non-taxation share: $31.5\% + 13.1\% = 44.6\%$.  
     - Taxation share: $100\% - 44.6\% = 55.4\%$, or $78.2 \times 0.554 = 43.3 \, \text{billion RM}$.  
   - **Equity Impact**: Reducing OOP to 20% (RM 15.64 billion) requires increasing taxation share to cover the gap (RM 24.6 - 15.64 = RM 8.96 billion), likely raising the taxation share to ~66.9%. This enhances **equity** by reducing **financial burdens** on low-income households, supporting **UHC** by improving access to subsidized care, as taxation spreads costs progressively (Slide 8).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Taxation share calculation (2 marks), equity impact explanation (2 marks), clarity (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

### HE 5: Health Insurance and Managed Care

7. **Scenario**: A Malaysian company offers private health insurance (PHI) to employees, with risk-rated premiums averaging RM 1,200 annually. Data shows 20% of employees forgo coverage due to high costs, and insured employees visit clinics 30% more than uninsured ones.  
   **Task**: Identify the **insurance market failures** at play and propose one strategy to address them in Malaysia.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Market Failures**:  
     - **Adverse Selection**: High-risk employees are more likely to join, increasing premiums (RM 1,200), causing 20% to forgo coverage, reducing the risk pool and raising costs (HE 5, Slide 23).  
     - **Moral Hazard**: Insured employees‚Äô 30% higher clinic visits indicate overuse due to reduced costs, inflating healthcare expenses (HE 5, Slide 43).  
   - **Strategy**: Introduce a **national social health insurance (SHI)** with **mandatory enrollment** and **community-rated premiums** to ensure broad coverage, reducing adverse selection and stabilizing costs, as seen in proposed Malaysian reforms (Slide 37).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Identification of adverse selection (1 mark), moral hazard (1 mark), strategy proposal with justification (2 marks), clarity (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

8. **Scenario**: A Malaysian managed care organization (MCO) implements primary care gatekeeping, requiring patients to see a GP before specialists. This reduces specialist visits by 25% but increases patient complaints about access delays.  
   **Task**: Explain how **gatekeeping** functions as a managed care technique and propose one solution to address patient complaints in Malaysia.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Gatekeeping**: A **demand-side control** where primary care providers coordinate care, limiting specialist referrals to reduce costs and unnecessary treatments, ensuring efficient resource use (HE 5, Slide 50). The 25% reduction in specialist visits reflects cost control.  
   - **Solution**: Implement **telemedicine triage** in Malaysia‚Äôs MCOs, allowing faster GP assessments to streamline referrals, reducing delays and improving patient satisfaction while maintaining gatekeeping benefits (Slide 50).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Explanation of gatekeeping (2 marks), solution proposal with justification (2 marks), clarity (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

### HE 6: Equality, Equity, and Social Justice

9. **Scenario**: In Malaysia, urban mothers have 80% coverage of skilled birth attendance, while rural mothers have 40% coverage. The rural infant mortality rate (IMR) is 10 per 1,000, compared to 6 per 1,000 in urban areas.  
   **Task**: Identify this disparity as an **inequality** or **inequity** and propose one population-level intervention to address it in Malaysia.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Inequity**: The disparity in skilled birth attendance (80% urban vs. 40% rural) and IMR (10 vs. 6 per 1,000) is an **inequity**, as it is **avoidable**, **unjust**, and tied to **systemic barriers** (e.g., rural healthcare access), not biology (HE 6, Slide 25).  
   - **Intervention**: Deploy **mobile maternal health units** in rural Malaysia to provide skilled birth attendance, reducing IMR by addressing **SDH** like access to care, a population-level approach (Slide 60).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Identification as inequity with justification (2 marks), intervention proposal (2 marks), clarity (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

10. **Scenario**: A Malaysian district with a 20% poverty rate has a tuberculosis (TB) prevalence of 120 per 100,000 among the poorest quintile, compared to 60 per 100,000 among the richest quintile. The national TB program considers a utilitarian approach to allocate resources.  
    **Task**: Explain how a **utilitarian approach** would guide resource allocation and propose an alternative **egalitarian liberalism-based** intervention to address this inequity.  
    **Answer Guide**:  
    - **Utilitarian Approach**: Prioritizes the **greatest good for the greatest number**, allocating resources to maximize overall TB reduction, potentially focusing on high-population areas rather than the poorest quintile, ignoring their higher need (HE 6, Slide 49).  
    - **Egalitarian Liberalism Intervention**: Fund **targeted TB screening** and treatment for the poorest quintile, ensuring **positive rights** to healthcare and addressing **equity** by prioritizing the disadvantaged, reducing the 120 vs. 60 per 100,000 gap (Slide 49).  
    **Marking Criteria**: Utilitarian approach explanation (2 marks), egalitarian intervention (2 marks), clarity (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

### HE 7: Government‚Äôs Role in the Health Sector

11. **Scenario**: Malaysia‚Äôs Ministry of Health observes that smoking-related diseases cost RM 3 billion annually in healthcare expenses, partly due to secondhand smoke. A proposed tobacco tax increase of RM 1 per pack is expected to reduce smoking prevalence by 5%.  
    **Task**: Explain how this **Pigouvian tax** addresses a market failure and calculate the potential cost savings if smoking prevalence drops by 5%.  
    **Answer Guide**:  
    - **Pigouvian Tax**: Taxes negative externalities (e.g., secondhand smoke) to align private and social costs, discouraging harmful behaviors like smoking, correcting market failure (HE 7, Slide 38).  
    - **Cost Savings**: Smoking-related costs = RM 3 billion. A 5% prevalence reduction implies $0.05 \times 3,000,000,000 = 150,000,000 \, \text{RM}$ in savings, assuming proportional cost reduction.  
    - **Impact**: The tax reduces **externalities**, lowering disease burden and healthcare costs, supporting Malaysia‚Äôs public health goals (Slide 38).  
    **Marking Criteria**: Pigouvian tax explanation (2 marks), cost savings calculation (2 marks), clarity (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

12. **Scenario**: A Malaysian private GP practice resists the proposed separation of prescribing and dispensing, citing a potential 20% revenue loss (RM 100,000 annually) from dispensing. Rural patients rely on the practice for one-stop services due to limited pharmacy access.  
    **Task**: Analyze one **merit** and one **challenge** of the separation policy and propose a solution to address the rural access issue.  
    **Answer Guide**:  
    - **Merit**: **Reduced provider-induced demand**, as separating roles eliminates GP incentives to over-prescribe, ensuring prescriptions are need-based, improving care quality (HE 7, Slide 3).  
    - **Challenge**: **Rural access** issues, as limited pharmacies force patients to travel, reducing care access for those reliant on one-stop GP services (Slide 3).  
    - **Solution**: Implement **mobile pharmacies** in rural Malaysia, delivering medications to remote areas, ensuring access while maintaining separation benefits (Slide 3).  
    **Marking Criteria**: Merit analysis (2 marks), challenge analysis (1 mark), solution proposal (1 mark), clarity (1 mark). **Total: 5 marks**.

These questions test **in-depth understanding**, **critical analysis**, and **policy application** by requiring students to synthesize concepts from **Demand for Health and Healthcare (HE 2)**, **Supply of Health Services (HE 3)**, **Financing Health Care (HE 4)**, **Health Insurance and Managed Care (HE 5)**, **Equality, Equity, and Social Justice (HE 6)**, and **Government‚Äôs Role in the Health Sector (HE 7)**. Each question includes a **prompt**, an **answer guide**, and **marking criteria**, ensuring **rigor** and **relevance** to lecture content. The questions incorporate **Malaysia-specific contexts** and **global perspectives**.

### HE 2: Demand for Health and Healthcare

1. **Prompt**: In Malaysia, private healthcare costs have risen by 15% over the past year, while rural household incomes have remained stagnant at an average of RM 2,000 per month. Discuss how **price elasticity of demand** and **income elasticity of demand** influence healthcare utilization in this context, and propose one policy to improve access for rural households.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Introduction**: **Price elasticity** ($\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \Delta Q}{\%\ \Delta P}$) and **income elasticity** ($\text{Income Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \Delta Q}{\%\ \Delta I}$) determine how price and income changes affect healthcare demand, critical for understanding access barriers in Malaysia (HE 2, Slide 12).  
   - **Price Elasticity Analysis**: A 15% cost increase likely reduces demand for private healthcare, especially for non-essential services (e.g., elective procedures), as **price elasticity** is high for low-income rural households. This limits utilization, forcing reliance on under-resourced public clinics (Slide 12).  
   - **Income Elasticity Analysis**: Stagnant incomes (RM 2,000/month) mean rural households cannot increase healthcare demand, as **income elasticity** (>1 for normal goods) suggests demand grows with income. Limited income restricts access to private care, exacerbating disparities (Slide 15).  
   - **Policy Proposal**: Subsidize **private clinic consultations** for rural households through a voucher system, reducing effective prices and boosting utilization, aligning with Malaysia‚Äôs Universal Health Coverage (UHC) goals (Slide 8).  
   - **Conclusion**: **Elasticities** highlight rural access challenges; targeted subsidies can enhance equity and utilization.  
   **Marking Criteria**: Introduction with elasticity definitions (2 marks), price elasticity analysis (3 marks), income elasticity analysis (3 marks), policy proposal with justification (3 marks), conclusion (2 marks). **Total: 13 marks**.

### HE 3: Supply of Health Services

2. **Prompt**: A private hospital in Malaysia operates under a fee-for-service model, leading to a 20% increase in diagnostic tests despite stable patient conditions. Analyze how **supplier-induced demand** and **information asymmetry** contribute to this trend, and propose one regulatory measure to address it in Malaysia‚Äôs private sector.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Introduction**: **Supplier-induced demand** occurs when providers encourage unnecessary services to increase income, exacerbated by **information asymmetry**, where patients lack medical knowledge (HE 3, Slide 18).  
   - **Supplier-Induced Demand Analysis**: The **fee-for-service** model incentivizes doctors to order more tests (20% increase) to boost revenue, as payments are tied to service volume. This exploits patients‚Äô trust, inflating costs without clinical justification (Slide 18).  
   - **Information Asymmetry Analysis**: Patients, unable to assess test necessity, rely on doctors, who leverage this knowledge gap to induce demand, compromising care quality and affordability in Malaysia‚Äôs private sector (Slide 15).  
   - **Regulatory Measure**: Mandate **clinical practice guidelines** for diagnostic tests in Malaysia‚Äôs private hospitals, enforced by the Malaysian Medical Council, to standardize care and reduce unnecessary procedures, ensuring evidence-based practice (Slide 18).  
   - **Conclusion**: **Supplier-induced demand** and **asymmetry** drive cost escalation; regulation promotes efficiency and patient welfare.  
   **Marking Criteria**: Introduction with definitions (2 marks), supplier-induced demand analysis (3 marks), information asymmetry analysis (3 marks), regulatory measure with justification (3 marks), conclusion (2 marks). **Total: 13 marks**.

### HE 4: Financing Health Care

3. **Prompt**: Malaysia‚Äôs 2021 Total Health Expenditure (THE) was RM 78.2 billion, with 31.5% from out-of-pocket (OOP) payments, higher than the WHO-recommended 20%. Discuss the implications of this high OOP share for **equity** and **financial protection**, and propose one financing reform to advance Malaysia‚Äôs UHC goals.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Introduction**: **Equity** ensures fair access to healthcare, and **financial protection** prevents financial hardship, both central to UHC. Malaysia‚Äôs 31.5% OOP share (RM 24.6 billion) signals financing challenges (HE 4, Slide 68).  
   - **Equity Implications**: High OOP burdens disproportionately affect **low-income households**, who may forgo care due to costs, widening rural-urban disparities (e.g., lower access in rural areas), undermining **equity** in Malaysia‚Äôs dual system (Slide 8).  
   - **Financial Protection Implications**: OOP exceeding 20% increases **catastrophic health payments** (>10% household consumption), risking poverty, especially for the poor, contrary to UHC‚Äôs goal of protecting against financial distress (Slide 8).  
   - **Financing Reform**: Increase **general taxation** to fund public healthcare, reducing OOP to 20% by subsidizing services at **Klinik Kesihatan**, enhancing **progressive financing** and access for the poor (Slide 35).  
   - **Conclusion**: High OOP hinders **equity** and **protection**; tax-based financing supports UHC in Malaysia.  
   **Marking Criteria**: Introduction with definitions (2 marks), equity implications (3 marks), financial protection implications (3 marks), financing reform with justification (3 marks), conclusion (2 marks). **Total: 13 marks**.

### HE 5: Health Insurance and Managed Care

4. **Prompt**: In Malaysia, private health insurance (PHI) covers only 25% of the population, with risk-rated premiums excluding high-risk groups, while social health insurance (SHI) is proposed to achieve UHC. Compare the roles of **PHI** and **SHI** in addressing **adverse selection** and **moral hazard**, and propose one managed care technique to enhance SHI efficiency in Malaysia.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Introduction**: **Adverse selection** (high-risk individuals dominating insurance) and **moral hazard** (overuse due to reduced costs) are insurance market failures. **PHI** and **SHI** differ in addressing these, impacting UHC (HE 5, Slides 23, 43).  
   - **PHI Analysis**: **Risk-rated premiums** in PHI increase costs for high-risk groups, exacerbating **adverse selection** by excluding them (25% coverage in Malaysia). **Moral hazard** persists, as insured patients overuse services (e.g., unnecessary consultations), with limited PHI controls (Slide 26).  
   - **SHI Analysis**: **Mandatory enrollment** and **community-rated premiums** in SHI reduce **adverse selection** by ensuring a broad risk pool. **Moral hazard** is managed through structured benefits (e.g., copayments), promoting equitable access (Slide 23).  
   - **Managed Care Technique**: Implement **capitation** in Malaysia‚Äôs SHI, paying providers a fixed amount per patient, discouraging overuse and aligning with cost control, as seen in managed care models (Slide 50).  
   - **Conclusion**: **SHI** better addresses insurance failures; **capitation** enhances efficiency for UHC.  
   **Marking Criteria**: Introduction with definitions (2 marks), PHI analysis (3 marks), SHI analysis (3 marks), managed care technique with justification (3 marks), conclusion (2 marks). **Total: 13 marks**.

### HE 6: Equality, Equity, and Social Justice

5. **Prompt**: Malaysia‚Äôs rural areas have a higher infant mortality rate (IMR) of 10 per 1,000 compared to 6 per 1,000 in urban areas, driven by limited healthcare access. Discuss how **social determinants of health (SDH)** contribute to this **inequity**, and propose one population-level intervention grounded in **egalitarian liberalism** to address it.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Introduction**: **SDH** (e.g., sanitation, education, income) shape health outcomes, driving **inequities**‚Äîavoidable, unjust disparities. Malaysia‚Äôs rural-urban IMR gap reflects systemic barriers (HE 6, Slide 56).  
   - **SDH Contribution**: Limited **healthcare access** (fewer clinics), **poor sanitation** (increasing infections), and **low income** (restricting care affordability) in rural Malaysia elevate IMR, as these **SDH** disproportionately harm the poor, creating an **inequity** (Slide 22).  
   - **Egalitarian Liberalism Intervention**: Fund a **national mobile health program** to deliver maternal and infant care in rural areas, ensuring **positive rights** to healthcare, reducing IMR by addressing access barriers, aligning with **fair equality of opportunity** (Slide 49).  
   - **Conclusion**: **SDH** drive rural inequities; **egalitarian liberalism** supports targeted interventions for equity.  
   **Marking Criteria**: Introduction with definitions (2 marks), SDH contribution analysis (3 marks), intervention with egalitarian justification (3 marks), conclusion (2 marks). **Total: 13 marks**.

### HE 7: Government‚Äôs Role in the Health Sector

6. **Prompt**: Malaysia‚Äôs healthcare system faces market failures, including negative externalities from smoking (RM 3 billion annual costs) and high OOP payments (31.5% of THE, 2021). Evaluate how **government interventions** like **Pigouvian taxes** and **public financing** address these failures, and propose one policy to enhance equity in Malaysia‚Äôs dual system, drawing on lessons from the UK‚Äôs NHS.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Introduction**: **Market failures** (externalities, high OOP) require **government interventions** like **Pigouvian taxes** and **public financing** to ensure **efficiency** and **equity**, critical for Malaysia‚Äôs dual system (HE 7, Slide 15).  
   - **Pigouvian Taxes Analysis**: Taxes on tobacco (e.g., RM 1 per pack increase) address **negative externalities** (e.g., RM 3 billion in smoking-related costs) by raising private costs, reducing consumption and healthcare burden, as seen in Malaysia‚Äôs sin taxes (Slide 38).  
   - **Public Financing Analysis**: Malaysia‚Äôs **55.4% tax-funded** share (2021) reduces **OOP burdens** (31.5%, RM 24.6 billion), enhancing **financial protection**, but high OOP persists, limiting **equity** for the poor (Slide 68, HE 4).  
   - **Policy Proposal (UK Lesson)**: Adopt a **NICE-like cost-effectiveness framework** to prioritize tax-funded services in Malaysia‚Äôs public sector, inspired by the UK‚Äôs NHS, ensuring equitable allocation to high-need rural areas, reducing OOP and disparities (Slide 62).  
   - **Conclusion**: **Taxes** and **financing** correct failures; a **NICE-inspired** approach enhances Malaysia‚Äôs equity.  
   **Marking Criteria**: Introduction with definitions (2 marks), Pigouvian taxes analysis (3 marks), public financing analysis (3 marks), policy proposal with UK lesson (3 marks), conclusion (2 marks). **Total: 13 marks**.

## üìã Case Study Questions

**Overview**: The following set of **case study questions** is designed for the **mid-semester test** (May 22, 2025) of the **MQB7014: Health Economics** module, covering **HE 2‚Äì7** (HE 1, Slide 11). These questions test **integrated understanding**, **critical analysis**, and **policy application** by presenting **real-world scenarios** that require students to apply concepts from **Demand for Health and Healthcare (HE 2)**, **Supply of Health Services (HE 3)**, **Financing Health Care (HE 4)**, **Health Insurance and Managed Care (HE 5)**, **Equality, Equity, and Social Justice (HE 6)**, and **Government‚Äôs Role in the Health Sector (HE 7)**. Each question includes a **scenario**, **tasks**, an **answer guide**, and **marking criteria**, ensuring **rigor** and **relevance** to lecture content. The questions integrate **Malaysia-specific contexts** and **global perspectives**.

### HE 2: Demand for Health and Healthcare

1. **Scenario**: In rural Malaysia, a private clinic charges RM 80 per consultation, and the average household income is RM 2,500 per month. After a 10% price increase to RM 88, monthly visits drop from 500 to 450. Historical data shows a 10% income increase leads to a 12% rise in healthcare demand. The Ministry of Health aims to improve rural healthcare access.  
   **Tasks**:  
   a) Calculate the **price elasticity of demand** and **income elasticity of demand** for clinic visits.  
   b) Analyze how these elasticities explain the rural community‚Äôs healthcare utilization patterns.  
   c) Propose one policy to enhance access, considering demand-side factors.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Task a: Calculations** (HE 2, Slide 12):  
     - **Price Elasticity**: $\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \Delta Q}{\%\ \Delta P}$.  
       - Price change: $\Delta P = 88 - 80 = 8$, so $\% \Delta P = \frac{8}{80} \times 100 = 10\%$.  
       - Quantity change: $\Delta Q = 450 - 500 = -50$, so $\% \Delta Q = \frac{-50}{500} \times 100 = -10\%$.  
       - Elasticity: $$\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{-10\%}{10\%} = -1$$, indicating **unit elastic demand**.  
     - **Income Elasticity**: $\text{Income Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \Delta Q}{\%\ \Delta I}$.  
       - Given: 10% income increase ($\% \Delta I = 10\%$) leads to 12% demand increase ($\% \Delta Q = 12\%$).  
       - Elasticity: $$\text{Income Elasticity} = \frac{12\%}{10\%} = 1.2$$, indicating healthcare is a **normal good** with elastic demand.  
   - **Task b: Analysis**:  
     - **Price Elasticity (-1)**: Unit elastic demand means a 10% price increase reduces visits by 10% (500 to 450), reflecting rural households‚Äô sensitivity to cost changes, limiting access to private care and increasing reliance on public clinics (Slide 12).  
     - **Income Elasticity (1.2)**: Demand rises faster than income, so stagnant incomes (RM 2,500) constrain utilization. A 10% income rise (to RM 2,750) could increase visits by 12%, but low incomes perpetuate low demand, exacerbating rural disparities (Slide 15).  
   - **Task c: Policy Proposal**: Introduce a **government-funded voucher program** for rural households, covering 50% of private clinic consultation costs (e.g., RM 44 at RM 88), reducing effective prices to boost demand and improve access, aligning with UHC goals (Slide 8).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Price elasticity calculation (2 marks), income elasticity calculation (2 marks), utilization analysis (3 marks), policy proposal with justification (3 marks). **Total: 10 marks**.

### HE 3: Supply of Health Services

2. **Scenario**: A private hospital in Penang operates under a fee-for-service model, charging RM 200 per diagnostic test. After investing RM 10 million in new imaging equipment, test orders rise by 25% (from 4,000 to 5,000 monthly), despite no change in patient health profiles. The hospital serves 60% low-income patients who face high out-of-pocket (OOP) costs.  
   **Tasks**:  
   a) Explain how **supplier-induced demand** and **information asymmetry** drive the increase in test orders.  
   b) Analyze the impact on low-income patients‚Äô healthcare costs.  
   c) Propose one regulatory measure to mitigate this issue in Malaysia‚Äôs private sector.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Task a: Explanation** (HE 3, Slide 18):  
     - **Supplier-Induced Demand**: The **fee-for-service** model incentivizes doctors to order more tests (25% increase) to recover the RM 10 million equipment cost and boost income, as payments are tied to service volume.  
     - **Information Asymmetry**: Patients, lacking medical expertise, rely on doctors‚Äô recommendations, enabling providers to induce unnecessary tests without patient scrutiny, exploiting the knowledge gap.  
   - **Task b: Impact Analysis**:  
     - The 25% increase (1,000 extra tests at RM 200) adds RM 200,000 monthly to costs, disproportionately affecting the **60% low-income patients** who pay OOP. This raises **financial burdens**, potentially leading to **catastrophic payments** or forgone care, worsening **equity** in Malaysia‚Äôs private sector (Slide 15).  
   - **Task c: Regulatory Measure**: Enforce **mandatory clinical audits** by the Malaysian Medical Council, requiring private hospitals to justify diagnostic test orders against evidence-based guidelines, reducing unnecessary procedures and protecting low-income patients from excessive costs (Slide 18).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Supplier-induced demand explanation (2 marks), information asymmetry explanation (2 marks), impact on low-income patients (3 marks), regulatory measure with justification (3 marks). **Total: 10 marks**.

### HE 4: Financing Health Care

3. **Scenario**: In 2021, Malaysia‚Äôs Total Health Expenditure (THE) was RM 78.2 billion, with 31.5% OOP (RM 24.6 billion), 13.1% private insurance, and 55.4% government taxation. A rural district reports 20% of households facing catastrophic health payments (>10% consumption) due to high OOP costs for chronic disease care.  
   **Tasks**:  
   a) Calculate the **OOP share** and **government taxation share** of THE.  
   b) Analyze how high OOP impacts **equity** and **financial protection** in the rural district.  
   c) Propose one financing reform to reduce catastrophic payments, drawing on global financing models.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Task a: Calculations** (HE 4, Slide 68):  
     - **OOP Share**: $$ \text{OOP Share} = \frac{24.6}{78.2} \times 100 = 31.5\% $$, or RM 24.6 billion of RM 78.2 billion.  
     - **Government Taxation Share**: Given OOP (31.5%) and private insurance (13.1%), non-taxation share = $31.5\% + 13.1\% = 44.6\%$. Taxation share: $$ 100\% - 44.6\% = 55.4\% $$, or $78.2 \times 0.554 = 43.3 \, \text{billion RM}$.  
   - **Task b: Impact Analysis**:  
     - **Equity**: High OOP (31.5%) burdens rural households, with 20% facing **catastrophic payments**, limiting access to chronic disease care and widening rural-urban disparities, as wealthier urban patients afford private care (Slide 8).  
     - **Financial Protection**: OOP exceeding WHO‚Äôs 20% threshold increases financial hardship, pushing rural households toward poverty, contrary to UHC‚Äôs goal of protecting against catastrophic costs (Slide 8).  
   - **Task c: Financing Reform**: Adopt a **tax-funded single-payer model**, inspired by the UK‚Äôs NHS, to reduce OOP to 20% by increasing government subsidies for rural clinics, covering chronic disease care and minimizing catastrophic payments (Slide 35).  
   **Marking Criteria**: OOP and taxation share calculations (2 marks), equity impact analysis (2 marks), financial protection impact analysis (2 marks), financing reform with global reference (2 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 10 marks**.

### HE 5: Health Insurance and Managed Care

4. **Scenario**: A Malaysian corporation provides private health insurance (PHI) to 5,000 employees, with risk-rated premiums averaging RM 1,500 annually. Only 70% enroll due to high costs, and insured employees average 6 clinic visits yearly vs. 4 for uninsured, costing RM 100 per visit. The government considers a social health insurance (SHI) model to cover all workers.  
   **Tasks**:  
   a) Calculate the **additional cost** from increased clinic visits due to moral hazard.  
   b) Compare **PHI** and **SHI** in addressing **adverse selection** and **moral hazard**.  
   c) Propose one managed care technique to enhance SHI efficiency in Malaysia.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Task a: Calculation** (HE 5, Slide 43):  
     - Insured employees: $5,000 \times 0.7 = 3,500$.  
     - Additional visits due to **moral hazard**: 6 (insured) ‚Äì 4 (uninsured) = 2 visits per person.  
     - Total additional visits: $3,500 \times 2 = 7,000$.  
     - Cost: $$ 7,000 \times 100 = 700,000 \, \text{RM annually} $$.  
   - **Task b: Comparison**:  
     - **Adverse Selection**: **PHI‚Äôs risk-rated premiums** (RM 1,500) exclude high-risk or low-income workers (30% non-enrolled), worsening **adverse selection** as only high-risk join, raising costs. **SHI‚Äôs mandatory enrollment** ensures a broad risk pool, reducing **adverse selection** (Slide 23).  
     - **Moral Hazard**: **PHI** struggles with **moral hazard** (7,000 extra visits, RM 700,000 cost), as insured overuse services. **SHI** mitigates this through structured benefits (e.g., copayments), controlling utilization (Slide 43).  
   - **Task c: Managed Care Technique**: Implement **primary care gatekeeping** in Malaysia‚Äôs SHI, requiring GP referrals for specialists, reducing unnecessary specialist visits and costs, as seen in managed care models (Slide 50).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Moral hazard cost calculation (2 marks), adverse selection comparison (2 marks), moral hazard comparison (2 marks), managed care technique with justification (2 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 10 marks**.

### HE 6: Equality, Equity, and Social Justice

5. **Scenario**: In a Malaysian state, the poorest 20% of households have an under-5 mortality rate of 12 per 1,000, double the richest 20%‚Äôs rate of 6 per 1,000. Access to skilled birth attendance is 50% for the poor vs. 90% for the rich, driven by limited rural healthcare. The state health department considers resource allocation.  
   **Tasks**:  
   a) Explain why this disparity is an **inequity** rather than an **inequality**, using **social determinants of health (SDH)**.  
   b) Analyze how a **utilitarian approach** vs. an **egalitarian liberalism approach** would guide resource allocation.  
   c) Propose one population-level intervention to address this inequity.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Task a: Inequity Explanation** (HE 6, Slide 25):  
     - The disparity (12 vs. 6 per 1,000) is an **inequity**, as it is **avoidable**, **unjust**, and tied to **SDH** like **limited healthcare access** (50% vs. 90% skilled birth attendance) and **poverty**, which restrict rural poor households‚Äô ability to secure care, unlike biological differences (Slide 56).  
   - **Task b: Resource Allocation Analysis** (HE 6, Slide 49):  
     - **Utilitarian Approach**: Prioritizes the **greatest good for the greatest number**, potentially allocating resources to urban areas with larger populations to maximize overall mortality reduction, neglecting the poor‚Äôs higher need (12 per 1,000).  
     - **Egalitarian Liberalism Approach**: Ensures **positive rights** to healthcare, directing resources to the poorest 20% to address their **disadvantage**, reducing the mortality gap by prioritizing **equity** over aggregate gains.  
   - **Task c: Intervention**: Launch a **state-wide mobile maternal health program** to provide skilled birth attendance in rural areas, targeting the poorest 20% to reduce under-5 mortality, using a **population-level** approach to address **SDH** like access (Slide 60).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Inequity explanation with SDH (2 marks), utilitarian analysis (2 marks), egalitarian liberalism analysis (2 marks), intervention proposal (2 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 10 marks**.

### HE 7: Government‚Äôs Role in the Health Sector

6. **Scenario**: Malaysia‚Äôs healthcare system faces high smoking-related costs (RM 3 billion annually) and a 31.5% OOP share (RM 24.6 billion of RM 78.2 billion THE, 2021). Rural areas lack pharmacies, complicating the proposed separation of prescribing and dispensing in private GP practices, which risks a 15% revenue loss for GPs.  
   **Tasks**:  
   a) Explain how **Pigouvian taxes** and **public financing** address **market failures** in this context.  
   b) Analyze the **equity implications** of the separation policy for rural patients.  
   c) Propose one policy to implement the separation policy while ensuring rural access, drawing on a global health system example.  
   **Answer Guide**:  
   - **Task a: Market Failures Explanation** (HE 7, Slide 38):  
     - **Pigouvian Taxes**: Address **negative externalities** (e.g., RM 3 billion smoking costs) by taxing tobacco to raise private costs, reducing consumption and healthcare burden, as seen in Malaysia‚Äôs sin taxes (Slide 38).  
     - **Public Financing**: Counters high OOP (31.5%) by funding public clinics (55.4% taxation share, RM 43.3 billion), reducing **financial barriers** and underprovision of **merit goods** like preventive care, supporting **equity** (Slide 50).  
   - **Task b: Equity Implications**:  
     - The **separation policy** risks **inequity** for rural patients, as limited pharmacies force travel, increasing costs and reducing access to medications. The 15% GP revenue loss may lead to clinic closures, further limiting rural care, exacerbating disparities (Slide 3).  
   - **Task c: Policy Proposal**: Implement the separation policy with **mobile pharmacy units**, inspired by Australia‚Äôs rural healthcare model, to deliver medications to remote Malaysian areas, ensuring access while reducing **provider-induced demand** through pharmacist oversight (Slide 3).  
   **Marking Criteria**: Pigouvian taxes explanation (2 marks), public financing explanation (2 marks), equity implications analysis (2 marks), policy proposal with global reference (2 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 10 marks**.

## üß© Synthesis Questions

**Overview**: The following set of **synthesis questions** is designed for the **mid-semester test** (May 22, 2025) of the **MQB7014: Health Economics** module, covering **HE 2‚Äì7** (HE 1, Slide 11). These questions test **integrated understanding**, **critical analysis**, and **cross-lecture application** by presenting **complex scenarios** that require students to synthesize concepts from **Demand for Health and Healthcare (HE 2)**, **Supply of Health Services (HE 3)**, **Financing Health Care (HE 4)**, **Health Insurance and Managed Care (HE 5)**, **Equality, Equity, and Social Justice (HE 6)**, and **Government‚Äôs Role in the Health Sector (HE 7)**. Each question includes a **scenario**, **tasks**, an **answer guide**, and **marking criteria**, ensuring **rigor** and **relevance** to lecture content. The questions integrate **Malaysia-specific contexts** and **global perspectives**.

### Question 1: Integrating HE 2, HE 4, and HE 6
**Scenario**: In a rural Malaysian district, the average household income is RM 2,000 per month, and private clinic consultations cost RM 100, with a 20% price increase planned (to RM 120). Data shows a 10% income rise increases healthcare demand by 15%, and 25% of households face catastrophic health payments (>10% consumption) due to high out-of-pocket (OOP) spending. The district‚Äôs infant mortality rate (IMR) is 12 per 1,000 for the poorest quintile, compared to 8 per 1,000 for the richest, driven by limited healthcare access. The Ministry of Health seeks to improve equity and access.  
**Tasks**:  
a) Calculate the **income elasticity of demand** for healthcare and analyze its implications for rural healthcare utilization.  
b) Explain how high OOP spending contributes to **health inequities**, using the IMR disparity and **social determinants of health (SDH)**.  
c) Propose one financing policy to reduce catastrophic payments and improve equity, drawing on a global example.  
**Answer Guide**:  
- **Task a: Income Elasticity Calculation and Analysis** (HE 2, Slide 15):  
  - **Calculation**: Income elasticity is $\text{Income Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \Delta Q}{\%\ \Delta I}$. Given a 10% income increase ($\% \Delta I = 10\%$) leads to a 15% demand increase ($\% \Delta Q = 15\%$), the elasticity is: $$ \text{Income Elasticity} = \frac{15\%}{10\%} = 1.5 $$, indicating healthcare is a **normal good** with elastic demand (Slide 15).  
  - **Implications**: The **1.5 elasticity** means demand rises faster than income, but stagnant incomes (RM 2,000) limit rural households‚Äô ability to afford RM 100‚Äì120 consultations, reducing utilization and forcing reliance on under-resourced public clinics. A 20% price increase may further deter visits, exacerbating access barriers (Slide 12).  
- **Task b: OOP and Health Inequities** (HE 4, Slide 8; HE 6, Slide 56):  
  - **OOP Contribution**: High OOP spending (25% catastrophic payments) burdens the poor, who forgo care due to costs, limiting access to maternal services and contributing to the **IMR inequity** (12 vs. 8 per 1,000). This is an **avoidable**, **unjust** disparity driven by **SDH** like **limited healthcare access** (fewer rural clinics) and **poverty** (low income), which restrict preventive care, unlike wealthier households with better access (HE 4, Slide 8; HE 6, Slide 25).  
- **Task c: Financing Policy** (HE 4, Slide 35):  
  - **Proposal**: Implement a **tax-funded subsidy program** for rural maternal and child health services, covering consultations and deliveries at public clinics, inspired by the UK‚Äôs NHS tax-funded model, which ensures free care at the point of service. This reduces OOP to below 20%, minimizing catastrophic payments and enhancing **equity** by targeting the poorest quintile (HE 4, Slide 35; HE 7, Slide 60).  
**Marking Criteria**: Income elasticity calculation and implications (3 marks), OOP and inequity analysis with SDH (3 marks), financing policy with global example (3 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 11 marks**.

### Question 2: Integrating HE 3, HE 5, and HE 7
**Scenario**: A private hospital in Kuala Lumpur operates under a fee-for-service model, charging RM 150 per consultation and RM 300 per diagnostic test. After new equipment investment, test orders rise by 20% (5,000 to 6,000 monthly), despite stable patient profiles. The hospital‚Äôs corporate health insurance plan covers 10,000 patients, with insured patients averaging 8 visits yearly vs. 5 for uninsured, costing RM 150 per visit. Malaysia‚Äôs Ministry of Health proposes separating prescribing and dispensing to reduce supplier-induced demand but faces rural access challenges.  
**Tasks**:  
a) Analyze how **supplier-induced demand** and **information asymmetry** drive the test order increase, referencing the fee-for-service model.  
b) Calculate the **additional cost** from increased visits due to **moral hazard** and explain its impact on insurance efficiency.  
c) Propose one government intervention to implement the separation policy while addressing rural access, considering **market failures**.  
**Answer Guide**:  
- **Task a: Supplier-Induced Demand and Information Asymmetry** (HE 3, Slide 18):  
  - **Supplier-Induced Demand**: The **fee-for-service** model incentivizes doctors to order more tests (20% increase, 1,000 extra tests) to recover equipment costs and boost income (RM 300 per test), as payments are volume-based, encouraging unnecessary procedures (Slide 18).  
  - **Information Asymmetry**: Patients, lacking medical expertise, rely on doctors‚Äô recommendations, enabling providers to induce demand without scrutiny, inflating costs and compromising care quality in Malaysia‚Äôs private sector (Slide 15).  
- **Task b: Moral Hazard Cost Calculation and Impact** (HE 5, Slide 43):  
  - **Calculation**: Insured patients (10,000) have 8 visits vs. 5 for uninsured, so additional visits per person = $8 - 5 = 3$. Total additional visits: $10,000 \times 3 = 30,000$. Cost: $$30,000 \times 150 = 4,500,000 \, \text{RM annually}$$.  
  - **Impact**: The RM 4.5 million cost from **moral hazard** (overuse due to reduced costs) strains insurance funds, reducing **efficiency** by increasing premiums or limiting coverage, potentially excluding high-risk patients and undermining UHC (Slide 43).  
- **Task c: Government Intervention** (HE 7, Slide 3):  
  - **Proposal**: Implement the **separation policy** with **subsidized mobile pharmacies** for rural areas, addressing the **market failure** of **provider-induced demand** (GPs over-prescribing for profit) and **underprovision** of pharmacies. Inspired by Australia‚Äôs rural telepharmacy, this ensures rural access while reducing dispensing incentives, enhancing **equity** and **efficiency** (Slide 38).  
**Marking Criteria**: Supplier-induced demand and asymmetry analysis (3 marks), moral hazard calculation and impact (3 marks), intervention proposal addressing market failures (3 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 11 marks**.

### Question 3: Integrating HE 4, HE 6, and HE 7
**Scenario**: In Malaysia (2021), Total Health Expenditure (THE) was RM 78.2 billion, with 31.5% OOP (RM 24.6 billion). A rural district reports 30% of households facing catastrophic health payments (>10% consumption) for chronic diseases, and the poorest quintile has a tuberculosis (TB) prevalence of 150 per 100,000 vs. 70 per 100,000 for the richest. Smoking-related costs (RM 3 billion annually) exacerbate the burden. The Ministry of Health aims to advance Universal Health Coverage (UHC).  
**Tasks**:  
a) Calculate the **OOP share** of THE and analyze its impact on **financial protection** in the rural district.  
b) Explain how **social determinants of health (SDH)** contribute to the TB **inequity**, referencing the prevalence gap.  
c) Propose one government policy to address both issues, integrating **public financing** and **Pigouvian taxes**, and justify using a global health system example.  
**Answer Guide**:  
- **Task a: OOP Share Calculation and Financial Protection** (HE 4, Slide 68):  
  - **Calculation**: $$ \text{OOP Share} = \frac{24.6}{78.2} \times 100 = 31.5\% $$, or RM 24.6 billion of RM 78.2 billion.  
  - **Impact**: The **31.5% OOP share** (exceeding WHO‚Äôs 20% threshold) leads to 30% of rural households facing **catastrophic payments**, undermining **financial protection** by increasing financial hardship and poverty risks, particularly for chronic disease care, contrary to UHC goals (Slide 8).  
- **Task b: SDH and TB Inequity** (HE 6, Slide 56):  
  - **SDH Contribution**: The TB prevalence gap (150 vs. 70 per 100,000) is an **inequity** driven by **SDH** like **poverty** (limiting treatment affordability), **poor living conditions** (e.g., overcrowding increasing transmission), and **limited healthcare access** (fewer rural clinics), which disproportionately affect the poorest quintile, making the disparity **avoidable** and **unjust** (Slide 25).  
- **Task c: Government Policy** (HE 7, Slides 38, 50):  
  - **Proposal**: Introduce a **dual intervention**: (1) Increase **public financing** through progressive taxation to fund free TB treatment and chronic disease care in rural clinics, reducing OOP and catastrophic payments; (2) Raise **Pigouvian taxes** on tobacco (e.g., RM 2 per pack) to curb smoking‚Äôs RM 3 billion cost, addressing **negative externalities**. Inspired by Thailand‚Äôs tax-funded ThaiHealth model, which uses sin taxes to finance health promotion, this policy enhances **equity** and **financial protection** (Slides 38, 60).  
**Marking Criteria**: OOP share calculation and financial protection impact (3 marks), SDH and TB inequity analysis (3 marks), policy proposal integrating financing and taxes with global example (3 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 11 marks**.

### Question 4: Integrating HE 2, HE 5, and HE 7
**Scenario**: In an urban Malaysian city, a private clinic charges RM 120 per consultation, with a planned 15% price increase to RM 138. Data shows monthly visits drop from 2,000 to 1,800 after the increase. The clinic‚Äôs corporate health insurance plan covers 60% of patients, who average 7 visits annually compared to 4 for uninsured patients, costing RM 120 per visit. The Malaysian government is concerned about rising healthcare costs and proposes a social health insurance (SHI) model to address market failures.  
**Tasks**:  
a) Calculate the **price elasticity of demand** for clinic visits and analyze its implications for insured vs. uninsured patients.  
b) Explain how **moral hazard** in the insurance plan contributes to cost escalation, including the additional cost from increased visits.  
c) Propose one government intervention to implement SHI, addressing **market failures** and ensuring cost control, with a global example.  
**Answer Guide**:  
- **Task a: Price Elasticity Calculation and Analysis** (HE 2, Slide 12):  
  - **Calculation**: Price elasticity is $\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \Delta Q}{\%\ \Delta P}$.  
    - Price change: $\Delta P = 138 - 120 = 18$, so $\% \Delta P = \frac{18}{120} \times 100 = 15\%$.  
    - Quantity change: $\Delta Q = 1,800 - 2,000 = -200$, so $\% \Delta Q = \frac{-200}{2,000} \times 100 = -10\%$.  
    - Elasticity: $$ \text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{-10\%}{15\%} = -0.667 $$, indicating **inelastic demand** (|0.667| < 1).  
  - **Implications**: The **inelastic demand** (-0.667) suggests a modest 10% visit reduction despite a 15% price increase, but **uninsured patients** (40%) are more sensitive, reducing visits significantly due to higher out-of-pocket (OOP) costs, limiting access. **Insured patients** (60%) are less affected, as insurance covers costs, maintaining utilization (Slide 12).  
- **Task b: Moral Hazard and Cost Escalation** (HE 5, Slide 43):  
  - **Moral Hazard**: Insured patients‚Äô 7 visits vs. 4 for uninsured (3 extra visits) reflect **moral hazard**, as reduced OOP costs encourage overuse (Slide 43).  
  - **Cost Calculation**: For 60% of 2,000 monthly patients (1,200 insured), annual visits = $1,200 \times 7 = 8,400$. Uninsured equivalent = $1,200 \times 4 = 4,800$. Additional visits: $8,400 - 4,800 = 3,600$. Cost: $$ 3,600 \times 120 = 432,000 \, \text{RM annually} $$.  
  - **Impact**: The RM 432,000 cost escalates premiums, reducing **insurance efficiency** and straining healthcare resources, a market failure requiring intervention (Slide 43).  
- **Task c: Government Intervention** (HE 7, Slide 37):  
  - **Proposal**: Implement a **mandatory SHI** with **community-rated premiums**, addressing **adverse selection** (high-risk exclusion in PHI) and **moral hazard** (via copayments). Inspired by Germany‚Äôs SHI, which uses mandatory enrollment and cost-sharing, this controls costs while ensuring universal coverage, enhancing **equity** and **efficiency** in Malaysia (Slides 37, 50).  
**Marking Criteria**: Price elasticity calculation and implications (3 marks), moral hazard analysis with cost calculation (3 marks), SHI intervention with global example (3 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 11 marks**.

### Question 5: Integrating HE 3, HE 6, and HE 7
**Scenario**: A Malaysian private hospital chain consolidates its operations, reducing average costs from RM 800 to RM 600 per patient by serving 50,000 patients annually instead of 20,000. The chain‚Äôs fee-for-service model leads to 30% unnecessary test orders, increasing costs for rural patients with limited insurance. The rural poorest quintile has a diabetes prevalence of 18% vs. 10% for the richest, linked to poor healthcare access. The government seeks to address these issues to promote equity.  
**Tasks**:  
a) Explain how **economies of scale** enable the cost reduction, including a calculation of total cost savings.  
b) Analyze how **supplier-induced demand** and **social determinants of health (SDH)** contribute to the **diabetes inequity**.  
c) Propose one government policy to reduce unnecessary tests and address the inequity, using an **egalitarian liberalism** approach.  
**Answer Guide**:  
- **Task a: Economies of Scale Calculation** (HE 3, Slide 12):  
  - **Economies of Scale**: Reduced average costs ($AC = \frac{TC}{Q}$) as output increases, spreading fixed costs over more patients (Slide 12).  
  - **Calculation**:  
    - Before: $AC = 800 \, \text{RM/patient}$, $Q = 20,000$, total cost: $$ TC = 800 \times 20,000 = 16,000,000 \, \text{RM} $$.  
    - After: $AC = 600 \, \text{RM/patient}$, $Q = 50,000$, total cost: $$ TC = 600 \times 50,000 = 30,000,000 \, \text{RM} $$.  
    - Without economies of scale, cost for 50,000 at RM 800: $$ 800 \times 50,000 = 40,000,000 \, \text{RM} $$.  
    - Savings: $$ 40,000,000 - 30,000,000 = 10,000,000 \, \text{RM annually} $$.  
  - **Implication**: The RM 10 million savings could lower prices or improve services, but benefits may not reach rural patients without intervention.  
- **Task b: Supplier-Induced Demand and SDH** (HE 3, Slide 18; HE 6, Slide 56):  
  - **Supplier-Induced Demand**: The **fee-for-service** model drives 30% unnecessary tests, increasing costs for rural patients who pay OOP, limiting access to diabetes care and exacerbating **inequity** (Slide 18).  
  - **SDH**: The **18% vs. 10% diabetes prevalence** reflects **inequity** due to **SDH** like **limited healthcare access** (fewer rural clinics), **poverty** (restricting treatment affordability), and **low health literacy**, which hinder prevention and management for the poor (Slide 25).  
- **Task c: Government Policy** (HE 7, Slide 50; HE 6, Slide 49):  
  - **Proposal**: Enforce **mandatory clinical audits** to curb unnecessary tests, combined with **tax-funded diabetes clinics** in rural areas, grounded in **egalitarian liberalism** to ensure **positive rights** to healthcare. Inspired by Canada‚Äôs public diabetes programs, this reduces costs and improves access for the poorest quintile, addressing **inequity** (Slides 50, 60).  
**Marking Criteria**: Economies of scale calculation and explanation (3 marks), supplier-induced demand and SDH analysis (3 marks), policy proposal with egalitarian justification (3 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 11 marks**.

### Question 6: Integrating HE 2, HE 4, and HE 5
**Scenario**: In Malaysia, a private hospital in a semi-urban area charges RM 200 per consultation, with visits dropping from 3,000 to 2,700 monthly after a 10% price increase to RM 220. Malaysia‚Äôs 2021 THE was RM 78.2 billion, with 31.5% OOP (RM 24.6 billion), and 20% of semi-urban households face catastrophic payments. The hospital‚Äôs private health insurance (PHI) plan covers 50% of patients, who average 6 visits yearly vs. 3 for uninsured, costing RM 200 per visit. The government considers financing and insurance reforms.  
**Tasks**:  
a) Calculate the **price elasticity of demand** for consultations and analyze its impact on OOP spending.  
b) Explain how high OOP and **catastrophic payments** relate to **insurance market failures** like moral hazard.  
c) Propose one integrated financing and insurance policy to reduce catastrophic payments, ensuring **financial protection**.  
**Answer Guide**:  
- **Task a: Price Elasticity Calculation and OOP Impact** (HE 2, Slide 12):  
  - **Calculation**: Price elasticity is $\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \Delta Q}{\%\ \Delta P}$.  
    - Price change: $\Delta P = 220 - 200 = 20$, so $\% \Delta P = \frac{20}{200} \times 100 = 10\%$.  
    - Quantity change: $\Delta Q = 2,700 - 3,000 = -300$, so $\% \Delta Q = \frac{-300}{3,000} \times 100 = -10\%$.  
    - Elasticity: $$\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{-10\%}{10\%} = -1$$, indicating **unit elastic demand**.  
  - **Impact**: Unit elastic demand (-1) means a 10% price increase reduces visits by 10%, increasing **OOP spending** for uninsured patients (50%) who pay RM 220, exacerbating **financial burdens** and contributing to the 20% catastrophic payment rate, as fewer visits do not offset higher costs (Slide 12).  
- **Task b: OOP, Catastrophic Payments, and Moral Hazard** (HE 4, Slide 8; HE 5, Slide 43):  
  - **OOP and Catastrophic Payments**: The **31.5% OOP share** (RM 24.6 billion) and 20% catastrophic payment rate (>10% consumption) reflect high financial burdens, limiting access for semi-urban households, especially uninsured ones facing RM 200‚Äì220 costs (HE 4, Slide 68).  
  - **Moral Hazard**: Insured patients‚Äô 6 visits vs. 3 for uninsured (3 extra visits) indicate **moral hazard**, as reduced OOP costs drive overuse, increasing costs (e.g., $1,500 \times 3 \times 200 = 900,000 \, \text{RM annually}$ for 1,500 insured), inflating premiums and exacerbating **insurance market failure** (HE 5, Slide 43).  
- **Task c: Financing and Insurance Policy** (HE 4, Slide 35; HE 5, Slide 37):  
  - **Proposal**: Introduce a **hybrid financing model** combining **increased tax-funded subsidies** for public clinics (reducing OOP to 20%) with a **mandatory SHI** using **community-rated premiums**, mitigating **moral hazard** via copayments. Inspired by Singapore‚Äôs Medisave, which blends public funding and mandatory savings, this ensures **financial protection** and equitable access for semi-urban households (HE 7, Slide 50).  
**Marking Criteria**: Price elasticity calculation and OOP impact (3 marks), OOP, catastrophic payments, and moral hazard analysis (3 marks), financing and insurance policy with justification (3 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 11 marks**.

### Question 7: Integrating HE 2, HE 3, and HE 6
**Scenario**: In a semi-urban Malaysian district, a private clinic charges RM 150 per consultation, with demand dropping from 1,500 to 1,350 visits monthly after a 10% price increase to RM 165. The clinic operates under a fee-for-service model, leading to 25% unnecessary prescriptions, costing patients an additional RM 50 per visit. The district‚Äôs poorest 20% have a hypertension prevalence of 22% compared to 12% for the richest 20%, linked to limited healthcare access and poor living conditions. The state health department aims to address these issues to promote health equity.  
**Tasks**:  
a) Calculate the **price elasticity of demand** for clinic visits and analyze its impact on healthcare utilization among the poorest 20%.  
b) Explain how **supplier-induced demand** contributes to the additional prescription costs and its effect on **health inequities**.  
c) Propose one intervention to reduce inequities, integrating **social determinants of health (SDH)** considerations, with a global example.  
**Answer Guide**:  
- **Task a: Price Elasticity Calculation and Analysis** (HE 2, Slide 12):  
  - **Calculation**: Price elasticity is $\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \Delta Q}{\%\ \Delta P}$.  
    - Price change: $\Delta P = 165 - 150 = 15$, so $\% \Delta P = \frac{15}{150} \times 100 = 10\%$.  
    - Quantity change: $\Delta Q = 1,350 - 1,500 = -150$, so $\% \Delta Q = \frac{-150}{1,500} \times 100 = -10\%$.  
    - Elasticity: $$\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{-10\%}{10\%} = -1$$, indicating **unit elastic demand**.  
  - **Impact**: The **unit elastic demand** (-1) means a 10% price increase reduces visits by 10% (1,500 to 1,350), disproportionately affecting the **poorest 20%**, who face higher out-of-pocket (OOP) costs, limiting access to hypertension care and worsening health outcomes due to financial constraints (Slide 12).  
- **Task b: Supplier-Induced Demand and Health Inequities** (HE 3, Slide 18; HE 6, Slide 25):  
  - **Supplier-Induced Demand**: The **fee-for-service** model incentivizes doctors to prescribe 25% unnecessary medications (RM 50 extra per visit), exploiting **information asymmetry** to increase revenue, inflating costs for patients (Slide 18).  
  - **Inequity Effect**: The **poorest 20%**, with higher hypertension prevalence (22% vs. 12%), face greater **financial burdens** from these costs, reducing treatment adherence and exacerbating **inequities**, as limited access and poverty (SDH) amplify disparities (Slide 56).  
- **Task c: Intervention with SDH** (HE 6, Slide 60):  
  - **Proposal**: Implement a **publicly funded hypertension screening and treatment program** in semi-urban clinics, addressing **SDH** like **healthcare access** and **poverty** by providing free services to the poorest 20%. Inspired by Brazil‚Äôs Family Health Strategy, which targets disadvantaged communities, this reduces unnecessary prescriptions through evidence-based care and promotes **equity** (HE 7, Slide 50).  
**Marking Criteria**: Price elasticity calculation and impact analysis (3 marks), supplier-induced demand and inequity analysis (3 marks), intervention proposal with SDH and global example (3 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 11 marks**.

### Question 8: Integrating HE 4, HE 5, and HE 7
**Scenario**: Malaysia‚Äôs 2021 Total Health Expenditure (THE) was RM 78.2 billion, with 31.5% OOP (RM 24.6 billion) and 13.1% private insurance. A rural district reports 25% of households facing catastrophic health payments (>10% consumption) for diabetes care. A private hospital‚Äôs insurance plan covers 40% of patients, with insured patients averaging 5 specialist visits yearly vs. 2 for uninsured, costing RM 250 per visit. The government proposes a national social health insurance (SHI) to reduce OOP and address market failures, but rural pharmacy shortages challenge the separation of prescribing and dispensing.  
**Tasks**:  
a) Calculate the **OOP share** of THE and analyze its impact on **catastrophic health payments** in the rural district.  
b) Explain how **moral hazard** in the insurance plan contributes to cost escalation, including the additional cost from specialist visits.  
c) Propose one integrated policy combining **SHI** and the **separation policy** to enhance **financial protection**, addressing rural challenges.  
**Answer Guide**:  
- **Task a: OOP Share Calculation and Catastrophic Payments** (HE 4, Slide 68):  
  - **Calculation**: $$ \text{OOP Share} = \frac{24.6}{78.2} \times 100 = 31.5\% $$, or RM 24.6 billion of RM 78.2 billion.  
  - **Impact**: The **31.5% OOP share**, exceeding WHO‚Äôs 20% threshold, drives 25% of rural households to **catastrophic health payments**, limiting diabetes care access and increasing financial hardship, particularly for uninsured patients facing high OOP costs, undermining **financial protection** (Slide 8).  
- **Task b: Moral Hazard and Cost Escalation** (HE 5, Slide 43):  
  - **Moral Hazard**: Insured patients‚Äô 5 visits vs. 2 for uninsured (3 extra visits) reflect **moral hazard**, as reduced OOP costs encourage overuse of specialist services (Slide 43).  
  - **Cost Calculation**: For 40% of 1,000 patients (400 insured), annual visits = $400 \times 5 = 2,000$. Uninsured equivalent = $400 \times 2 = 800$. Additional visits: $2,000 - 800 = 1,200$. Cost: $$1,200 \times 250 = 300,000 \, \text{RM annually}$$.  
  - **Impact**: The RM 300,000 cost inflates premiums, reducing **insurance efficiency** and exacerbating **market failure**, as resources are misallocated (Slide 43).  
- **Task c: Integrated Policy** (HE 7, Slide 37; HE 5, Slide 23):  
  - **Proposal**: Launch a **national SHI** with **mandatory enrollment** and **community-rated premiums**, integrating the **separation policy** by subsidizing **mobile pharmacies** for rural areas. This addresses **moral hazard** (via copayments), **adverse selection** (broad risk pool), and **rural access** issues, enhancing **financial protection**. Inspired by Japan‚Äôs SHI, which combines universal coverage with pharmacy networks, this promotes **equity** and **efficiency** (Slides 37, 3).  
**Marking Criteria**: OOP share calculation and catastrophic payment impact (3 marks), moral hazard analysis with cost calculation (3 marks), integrated policy proposal with global example (3 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 11 marks**.

### Question 9: Integrating HE 2, HE 6, and HE 7
**Scenario**: In a Malaysian rural district, a public clinic charges RM 20 per consultation, with visits dropping from 4,000 to 3,600 monthly after a 25% price increase to RM 25. The district‚Äôs under-5 mortality rate is 15 per 1,000 for the poorest 20% vs. 7 per 1,000 for the richest 20%, linked to inadequate maternal care access. Smoking-related diseases cost RM 500 million annually in the state, driven by high tobacco use. The Ministry of Health aims to improve child health and reduce costs through government interventions.  
**Tasks**:  
a) Calculate the **price elasticity of demand** for clinic visits and analyze its impact on maternal care access for the poorest 20%.  
b) Explain how **social determinants of health (SDH)** contribute to the **under-5 mortality inequity**, referencing the mortality gap.  
c) Propose one government intervention combining **Pigouvian taxes** and a **population-level approach** to address both issues, with a global example.  
**Answer Guide**:  
- **Task a: Price Elasticity Calculation and Maternal Care Access** (HE 2, Slide 12):  
  - **Calculation**: Price elasticity is $\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \Delta Q}{\%\ \Delta P}$.  
    - Price change: $\Delta P = 25 - 20 = 5$, so $\% \Delta P = \frac{5}{20} \times 100 = 25\%$.  
    - Quantity change: $\Delta Q = 3,600 - 4,000 = -400$, so $\% \Delta Q = \frac{-400}{4,000} \times 100 = -10\%$.  
    - Elasticity: $$\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{-10\%}{25\%} = -0.4$$, indicating **inelastic demand** (|0.4| < 1).  
  - **Impact**: The **inelastic demand** (-0.4) means a 25% price increase reduces visits by only 10%, but the **poorest 20%** are more sensitive, reducing **maternal care** visits (e.g., prenatal check-ups) due to cost barriers, worsening child health outcomes and contributing to the under-5 mortality gap (Slide 12).  
- **Task b: SDH and Under-5 Mortality Inequity** (HE 6, Slide 56):  
  - **SDH Contribution**: The **15 vs. 7 per 1,000 mortality gap** is an **inequity** driven by **SDH** like **limited healthcare access** (fewer rural clinics), **poverty** (restricting care affordability), and **poor living conditions** (e.g., sanitation), which increase infection risks for the poorest 20%, making the disparity **avoidable** and **unjust** (Slide 25).  
- **Task c: Government Intervention** (HE 7, Slide 38; HE 6, Slide 60):  
  - **Proposal**: Introduce a **Pigouvian tax** on tobacco (e.g., RM 1.5 per pack) to reduce smoking‚Äôs RM 500 million cost, funding a **population-level maternal health campaign** providing free prenatal care and vaccinations in rural clinics. Inspired by Australia‚Äôs tobacco tax-funded health programs, this addresses **externalities** and **SDH** (access, poverty), reducing mortality inequities (Slides 38, 60).  
**Marking Criteria**: Price elasticity calculation and maternal care impact (3 marks), SDH and mortality inequity analysis (3 marks), intervention proposal with global example (3 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 11 marks**.

### Question 10: Integrating HE 3, HE 4, and HE 5
**Scenario**: A Malaysian private hospital chain, serving 30,000 patients annually, consolidates operations, reducing average costs from RM 900 to RM 700 per patient. Operating under a fee-for-service model, it reports a 20% increase in diagnostic tests (from 10,000 to 12,000 monthly), costing RM 200 per test, driven by financial incentives. Malaysia‚Äôs 2021 Total Health Expenditure (THE) was RM 78.2 billion, with 31.5% out-of-pocket (OOP) payments, and the hospital‚Äôs private health insurance (PHI) plan covers 50% of patients, who average 6 consultations yearly vs. 3 for uninsured, at RM 150 per consultation. The government aims to enhance financial protection and efficiency.  
**Tasks**:  
a) Calculate the **total cost savings** from economies of scale and analyze its potential impact on patient costs.  
b) Explain how **supplier-induced demand** and **moral hazard** contribute to increased hospital costs, including the additional consultation cost.  
c) Propose one policy integrating **public financing** and a **managed care technique** to improve financial protection, with a global example.  
**Answer Guide**:  
- **Task a: Economies of Scale Calculation and Impact** (HE 3, Slide 12):  
  - **Calculation**: Economies of scale reduce average costs ($AC = \frac{TC}{Q}$) as output increases (Slide 12).  
    - Before: $AC = 900 \, \text{RM/patient}$, $Q = 30,000$, total cost: $$ TC = 900 \times 30,000 = 27,000,000 \, \text{RM} $$.  
    - After: $AC = 700 \, \text{RM/patient}$, $Q = 30,000$, total cost: $$ TC = 700 \times 30,000 = 21,000,000 \, \text{RM} $$.  
    - Savings: $$ 27,000,000 - 21,000,000 = 6,000,000 \, \text{RM annually} $$.  
  - **Impact**: The RM 6 million savings could lower patient fees or improve services, but high **OOP payments** (31.5% of THE) mean uninsured patients may not benefit, as costs remain high (e.g., RM 200 tests, RM 150 consultations), limiting **financial protection** (HE 4, Slide 68).  
- **Task b: Supplier-Induced Demand and Moral Hazard** (HE 3, Slide 18; HE 5, Slide 43):  
  - **Supplier-Induced Demand**: The **fee-for-service** model drives a 20% test increase (2,000 extra tests, $2,000 \times 200 = 400,000 \, \text{RM monthly}$), as doctors exploit **information asymmetry** to boost revenue, inflating costs (Slide 18).  
  - **Moral Hazard**: Insured patients‚Äô 6 consultations vs. 3 for uninsured (3 extra visits) reflect **moral hazard**, with 50% of 30,000 patients (15,000 insured) generating $15,000 \times 3 \times 150 = 6,750,000 \, \text{RM annually}$ in extra costs, increasing premiums and straining resources (Slide 43).  
- **Task c: Integrated Policy** (HE 4, Slide 35; HE 5, Slide 50):  
  - **Proposal**: Increase **public financing** through taxation to subsidize consultations at public clinics, reducing OOP below 20%, and implement **capitation** in managed care to pay providers a fixed fee per patient, curbing **supplier-induced demand** and **moral hazard**. Inspired by the Netherlands‚Äô managed care model, which uses capitation and public subsidies, this enhances **financial protection** and **efficiency** (HE 7, Slide 50).  
**Marking Criteria**: Economies of scale calculation and impact (3 marks), supplier-induced demand and moral hazard analysis with cost (3 marks), policy proposal with global example (3 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 11 marks**.

### Question 11: Integrating HE 2, HE 5, and HE 6
**Scenario**: In a Malaysian urban area, a private clinic charges RM 100 per consultation, with visits dropping from 2,500 to 2,250 monthly after a 20% price increase to RM 120. The clinic‚Äôs private health insurance (PHI) covers 60% of patients, who average 8 visits yearly vs. 4 for uninsured, costing RM 100 per visit. The area‚Äôs poorest 20% have a maternal mortality rate (MMR) of 30 per 100,000 compared to 15 per 100,000 for the richest 20%, linked to limited access and low health literacy. The Ministry of Health seeks to improve maternal health equity.  
**Tasks**:  
a) Calculate the **price elasticity of demand** for consultations and analyze its impact on the poorest 20%‚Äôs healthcare access.  
b) Explain how **moral hazard** in PHI and **social determinants of health (SDH)** contribute to the **MMR inequity**.  
c) Propose one policy integrating **insurance reform** and a **population-level approach** to reduce the inequity, with a global example.  
**Answer Guide**:  
- **Task a: Price Elasticity Calculation and Access Impact** (HE 2, Slide 12):  
  - **Calculation**: Price elasticity is $\text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{\%\ \Delta Q}{\%\ \Delta P}$.  
    - Price change: $\Delta P = 120 - 100 = 20$, so $\% \Delta P = \frac{20}{100} \times 100 = 20\%$.  
    - Quantity change: $\Delta Q = 2,250 - 2,500 = -250$, so $\% \Delta Q = \frac{-250}{2,500} \times 100 = -10\%$.  
    - Elasticity: $$ \text{Price Elasticity} = \frac{-10\%}{20\%} = -0.5 $$, indicating **inelastic demand** (|0.5| < 1).  
  - **Impact**: The **inelastic demand** (-0.5) means a 20% price increase reduces visits by 10%, but the **poorest 20%**, uninsured and income-constrained, reduce **maternal care** visits (e.g., prenatal check-ups) more significantly, limiting access and contributing to the MMR inequity (Slide 12).  
- **Task b: Moral Hazard and SDH** (HE 5, Slide 43; HE 6, Slide 56):  
  - **Moral Hazard**: Insured patients‚Äô 8 visits vs. 4 for uninsured (4 extra visits) reflect **moral hazard**, with 60% of 2,500 patients (1,500 insured) generating $1,500 \times 4 \times 100 = 600,000 \, \text{RM annually}$ in extra costs, inflating premiums and excluding the poor from PHI, limiting their care access (Slide 43).  
  - **SDH**: The **MMR inequity** (30 vs. 15 per 100,000) is driven by **SDH** like **limited healthcare access** (fewer clinics for the poor), **low health literacy** (reducing preventive care use), and **poverty** (restricting affordability), making the disparity **avoidable** and **unjust** (Slide 25).  
- **Task c: Integrated Policy** (HE 5, Slide 37; HE 6, Slide 60):  
  - **Proposal**: Implement a **mandatory social health insurance (SHI)** with **community-rated premiums** to cover maternal care, combined with a **population-level health literacy campaign** to educate the poorest 20% on prenatal care. Inspired by South Africa‚Äôs National Health Insurance efforts, this addresses **adverse selection**, **moral hazard** (via copayments), and **SDH**, reducing MMR inequities (HE 7, Slide 37).  
**Marking Criteria**: Price elasticity calculation and access impact (3 marks), moral hazard and SDH analysis (3 marks), policy proposal with global example (3 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 11 marks**.

### Question 12: Integrating HE 3, HE 6, and HE 7
**Scenario**: A Malaysian private hospital in a rural area, serving 20,000 patients annually, adopts economies of scale, reducing average costs from RM 1,000 to RM 800 per patient. Its fee-for-service model leads to 15% unnecessary surgical procedures, costing RM 5,000 each, driven by profit motives. The rural poorest 20% have a cardiovascular disease prevalence of 25% vs. 15% for the richest 20%, linked to poor diet and healthcare access. The government aims to reduce costs and promote equity, with smoking-related costs at RM 1 billion annually in the state.  
**Tasks**:  
a) Calculate the **total cost savings** from economies of scale and analyze its potential impact on rural healthcare costs.  
b) Explain how **supplier-induced demand** and **social determinants of health (SDH)** contribute to the **cardiovascular inequity**.  
c) Propose one policy integrating a **Pigouvian tax** and an **egalitarian liberalism approach** to address both issues, with a global example.  
**Answer Guide**:  
- **Task a: Economies of Scale Calculation and Impact** (HE 3, Slide 12):  
  - **Calculation**: Economies of scale reduce average costs ($AC = \frac{TC}{Q}$) as output increases.  
    - Before: $AC = 1,000 \, \text{RM/patient}$, $Q = 20,000$, total cost: $$ TC = 1,000 \times 20,000 = 20,000,000 \, \text{RM} $$.  
    - After: $AC = 800 \, \text{RM/patient}$, $Q = 20,000$, total cost: $$ TC = 800 \times 20,000 = 16,000,000 \, \text{RM} $$.  
    - Savings: $$ 20,000,000 - 16,000,000 = 4,000,000 \, \text{RM annually} $$.  
  - **Impact**: The RM 4 million savings could lower fees, but high **OOP costs** (e.g., RM 5,000 surgeries) and rural poverty mean the **poorest 20%** may not benefit, as access remains limited, exacerbating cardiovascular care disparities (HE 4, Slide 8).  
- **Task b: Supplier-Induced Demand and SDH** (HE 3, Slide 18; HE 6, Slide 56):  
  - **Supplier-Induced Demand**: The **fee-for-service** model drives 15% unnecessary surgeries (e.g., 300 extra procedures for 2,000 surgeries, $300 \times 5,000 = 1,500,000 \, \text{RM}$), exploiting **information asymmetry** to increase revenue, raising costs for rural patients (Slide 18).  
  - **SDH**: The **25% vs. 15% cardiovascular prevalence** is an **inequity** driven by **SDH** like **poor diet** (limited access to healthy food), **limited healthcare access** (fewer specialists), and **poverty** (restricting care affordability), disproportionately affecting the poor (Slide 25).  
- **Task c: Integrated Policy** (HE 7, Slide 38; HE 6, Slide 49):  
  - **Proposal**: Introduce a **Pigouvian tax** on tobacco (e.g., RM 2 per pack) to reduce smoking‚Äôs RM 1 billion cost, funding **tax-subsidized cardiovascular clinics** in rural areas, grounded in **egalitarian liberalism** to ensure **positive rights** to care for the poorest 20%. Inspired by Mexico‚Äôs tobacco tax-funded health programs, this addresses **externalities** and **SDH**, reducing inequities (Slides 38, 50).  
**Marking Criteria**: Economies of scale calculation and cost impact (3 marks), supplier-induced demand and SDH analysis (3 marks), policy proposal with egalitarian approach and global example (3 marks), clarity and coherence (2 marks). **Total: 11 marks**.
