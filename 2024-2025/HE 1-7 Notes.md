## 🌍 **4. Foundations of Economics and Health Economics**

### 📖 **What is Economics?**
- **Definition**: *“Economics is the study of how people make choices under the condition of scarcity and of the results of those choices on society.”*  
  - Source: Frank R and Bernanke B. (2001). *Principles of Economics*. McGraw-Hill, Singapore, p. 4.
- **Core Concept**: Examines **human behavior** when **resources are limited** and **wants are unlimited**, necessitating **choices** and **trade-offs**.
- **Focus**: *“Study on human behaviour particularly focusing on how choices are made or different alternatives are chosen.”*

### 💡 **Economic Concept of Scarcity**
- **Definition**: *“A condition in which people cannot have all the goods and services that they want.”*
- **Causes**: Human wants **exceed** available resources (e.g., land, labor, capital).
- **Consequences**:
  - Forces **choices** (e.g., prioritizing one service over another).
  - Requires **sacrifices** (e.g., giving up some goods to obtain others).

### 🩺 **What is Health Economics?**
- **Definition**: *“The study of how resources are allocated to and within the health economy.”*  
  - Source: Sherman F, Goodman A C, Stano M. (2005). *The Economics of Health and Health Care*, 4th Ed., p. 1.
- **Focus**: Analyzes **resource allocation** to meet **health needs**, balancing efficiency and equity.

### 🧠 **Economics in Everyday Life**
- **Key Insight**: *“We all behave as economists, knowingly or unknowingly.”*
- **Examples**:
  - **Household Budgeting**: Managing limited income.
  - **Family Decisions**: Choosing to have children or selecting schools.
  - **Consumer Behavior**: Seeking maximum satisfaction at the lowest price (e.g., Lazada/Shopee 11.11/12.12 sales).
  - **Work-Life Balance**: Opting for overtime or prioritizing family time over promotions.

## ❓ **6. Relevance of Economics in Health**

### 🩺 **Why Economics Matters**
- **Resource Consumption**: Healthcare consumes **significant national resources**, competing with sectors like defense, education, housing, and public transportation.
- **Limited Resources**: *“No country can provide unlimited access to quality care.”*
  - **Rationing** is inevitable due to **boundless health needs** and **limited resources**.
- **Societal Impact**: Policy choices affect society, e.g.:
  - **Free Compulsory Immunizations**: Achieve **herd immunity**.
  - **Public vs. Private Care**: Impacts **equity and accessibility**.
  - **Migrant Healthcare Policies**: Affects local population health.

### 🤔 **Common Doubts**
- **Health as a Technical Matter**: Should be left to experts, not patients.
- **Patient Irrationality**: Patients may not make informed choices.
- **Professional Autonomy**: *“The ability of particular professionals to make decisions that are not subject to authoritative review by those outside of the profession.”*
- **Health as a Right**: Limited resources shouldn’t restrict access.
- **Market Unsuitability**: Healthcare shouldn’t be left to market forces.

### ✅ **Counterargument: Economics is Essential**
- **Resource Allocation**: Balances health with other societal needs.
- **Prioritization**: Manages **scarce resources** efficiently.
- **Policy Impact**: Ensures decisions benefit society.

## 🏥 **7. Why is Healthcare Different?**

Healthcare’s unique characteristics distinguish it from other sectors:

| **Feature**            | **Explanation** |
|------------------------|---------------|
| **Uncertainty** ⚕️     | Unpredictable illness occurrence and treatment outcomes. |
| **Asymmetry of Information** 📚 | Professionals know more than patients, as medicine is a technical subject. |
| **Externalities** 🤝   | Interventions (e.g., vaccinations) provide shared benefits (e.g., herd immunity). |
| **Provider Monopolies** 🏥 | Fewer providers limit patient choices, especially in rural areas. |

- **Core Belief**: *“Most people value health and consider healthcare a basic human right.”*

### 📜 **The Right to Health**
- **Definition**: *“The right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is a fundamental human right.”*  
  - Source: OHCHR & WHO. *Right to Health. Fact Sheet 31*.
- **Origin**: Articulated in the **1946 WHO Constitution**, defining health as:
  - *“A state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”*
- **Implication**: Health is a **universal right**, transcending race, religion, or socioeconomic status.

---

## 🧠 **8. Core Economic Concepts**

### 📚 **Defining Health**
- **WHO Definition**: *“Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”*
- **Evans’ Definition**: *“Healthcare includes goods and services used primarily for their anticipated positive impact on health status, distinct from commodities consumed for direct satisfaction.”*
- **Scope**:
  - **Curing diseases** and managing illnesses.
  - **Health promotion and protection** (e.g., diagnosis, treatment).

### 🔍 **The Economic Problem**
1. **Limited Resources**: Finite **land, labor, and capital** for producing goods and services.
2. **Unlimited Wants**: Requires **choices** on resource use.
3. **Rational Behavior**: Assumes individuals aim to **maximize benefits** efficiently.
4. **Efficiency**: Achieved by **minimizing costs** to **maximize outcomes**.

### 📝 **Key Economic Terms**
| **Term**                | **Definition** |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Microeconomics**      | Focuses on individual units (e.g., patients, providers) and their decisions. |
| **Macroeconomics**      | Examines aggregate decisions (e.g., national health policies) and their economic impact. |
| **Positive Economics**  | Deals with factual assessments (e.g., healthcare spending data). |
| **Normative Economics** | Involves value judgments (e.g., whether healthcare should be free). |

## 🤝 **9. The Rational Person**

### 🧑‍💼 **Who is the Rational Person?**
- **Definition**: *“A person with well-defined goals who tries to fulfill those goals as best they can.”*
- **Characteristics** (Homo Economicus):
  - Possesses **knowledge** and the ability to use it.
  - Can assess **benefits and costs** with certainty.
  - Aims to achieve **maximum utility** within constraints.

### 🎯 **What is Utility?**
- **Definition**: *“The advantage, fulfillment, or satisfaction a person receives from consuming goods or services.”*

### ⚖️ **Rational Decision-Making**
- **Principle**: Actions aim to **maximize utility**.
- **Process**: Weighs **costs** (including **opportunity costs**) against **benefits**, often at the **margins**.

---

## 📉 **10. Scarcity and Decision-Making**

### 🍽️ **Scarcity Principle (No-Free-Lunch Principle)**
- **Definition**: *“Although we have boundless needs and wants, the resources available to us are limited. So having more of one good usually means having less of another.”*
- **Implication**: Choices involve **trade-offs** due to resource constraints.

### ⚖️ **Cost-Benefit Principle**
- **Definition**: *“An individual (or a firm or society) should take an action if, and only if, the extra benefits from taking the action are at least as great as the extra cost.”*
- **Formula**: **Benefits ≥ Costs**.
- **Example**: Pursuing a **Master of Public Health (MPH)** is rational only if the **benefits** (e.g., career advancement) outweigh the **costs** (e.g., fees, lost income).

### 💸 **Opportunity Costs**
- **Definition**: *“The value of the next best alternative that must be forgone to undertake an activity.”*
- **Key Idea**: Using resources in one way **prevents their use elsewhere**, and the cost is the **best alternative forgone**.
- **Example**:
  - **Choice**: Studying for an MPH.
  - **Costs**: RM 4,800/month (fees: RM 800, expenses: RM 2,000, lost salary: RM 2,000).
  - **Opportunity Cost**: Forgoing a job with a **RM 2,000/month salary**.
- **Implication**: *“The fact that you are here means that the benefits of pursuing a master’s in UM are worth at least RM 4,800 a month to you.”*

### 📊 **Illustrative Cost Breakdown (Fictional)**
| **Cost Component**         | **Amount (RM/month)** |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Tuition Fees               | 800                   |
| Living Expenses (Rental, Food, Transport) | 2,000         |
| Lost Salary (Opportunity Cost) | 2,000             |
| **Total**                  | **4,800**             |

- **Challenge**: Decide how many **cakes** or **tins of cookies** to produce.
- **Tool**: **Production Possibility Curve (PPC)** to visualize trade-offs, showing combinations of cakes and cookies possible within the budget.

### 🤔 **Decision-Making**
- **Task**: Choose the combination that **maximizes utility** (satisfaction for Hari Raya).
- **Rational Approach**: Weigh **costs** and **benefits** of each option, considering trade-offs (e.g., more cakes mean fewer cookies).

---

## 📈 **12. Marginal Analysis**

### 🔍 **What is Marginal Analysis?**
- **Definition**: *“In making a decision, the relevant costs and benefits are marginal costs and marginal benefits.”*
- **Components**:
  - **Marginal Benefits**: Additional gain from consuming/producing **one more unit** of a good/service.
  - **Marginal Costs**: Additional cost of consuming/producing **one more unit**.
- **Focus**: Decisions involve **incremental changes**, not all-or-nothing choices.

### 🌟 **Relevance**
- **Examples**:
  - Baking **3, 4, or 5 cakes**.
  - Eating **one more slice of bread** instead of one.
  - Building **an additional hospital** or clinic.
- **Application**: Optimizes resource use by evaluating **marginal impacts**, rarely requiring all-or-nothing decisions.

# HE 2 - Basic Economic Tools

**MQB7014: Health Economics**  
**Master of Public Health (MPH) Programme, University of Malaya**  
**Prepared by: Nithiah Thangiah**  
**Acknowledgement: Prof. Ng Chiu Wan, Dept. of Social and Preventive Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya**  

---

## 📚 1. Introduction to Basic Economic Tools  

**Health Economics** employs fundamental economic tools to analyze resource allocation in healthcare systems. This lecture covers **utility measurement**, **supply and demand dynamics**, **price and cross elasticities**, and **market structures**, emphasizing **perfectly competitive markets**. These tools are essential for understanding healthcare markets and informing policy decisions.  

### 🎯 Lecture Objectives  
- **Understand**: The dynamics of **supply and demand** in markets.  
- **Explore**: **Utility** and its measurement, including the **diamond-water paradox**.  
- **Analyze**: **Price elasticity** and **cross elasticity** in healthcare contexts.  
- **Examine**: Market structures, particularly **perfect competition**, and their relevance to efficiency.  
- **Apply**: Economic principles to healthcare, supported by empirical studies (e.g., Rand Health Insurance Experiments, Madagascar fee exemptions).  

---

## 🧠 2. Measuring Utility  

### 📏 What is Utility?  
- **Definition**: *Utility represents the satisfaction, advantage, or value a person derives from consuming a good or service.*  
- **Measurement Challenge**:  
  - No standardized unit exists (e.g., **“Utils”** is a hypothetical concept).  
  - **Money** is used as a proxy, where the **price paid** for a good or service reflects the **satisfaction** (utility) obtained.  
- **Key Insight**: *The price we pay for a good or service reflects the amount of satisfaction or value we obtain from consuming that good or service.*  

### 💎 The Diamond-Water Paradox  
- **Concept**: Highlights the discrepancy between **total utility** and **marginal utility**.  
  - **Water**:  
    - High **total utility** due to its essential role in survival.  
    - Low **marginal utility** and price because it is abundant.  
  - **Diamonds**:  
    - Lower **total utility** as they are non-essential.  
    - High **marginal utility** and price due to scarcity.  
- **Implication**: Prices are driven by **scarcity** and **marginal utility**, not just total utility.  

---

## 📈 3. Dynamics of Demand  

### 🛒 Understanding Demand  
- **Perspective**: From the **customer’s viewpoint**.  
- **Definition**: *Demand is the amount of a product (good or service) that customers are willing and able to buy over a period of time.*  
- **Key Determinants**:  
  - **Price** of the product (primary factor).  
  - **Non-price factors**: Income, prices of related goods (substitutes or complements), consumer preferences, and tastes.  

### ⚖️ Law of Demand  
- **Statement**: *Other things being equal, when the price of a product rises, the quantity demanded falls, and when the price falls, the quantity demanded rises.*  
- **Intuition**: Higher prices reduce affordability, decreasing demand, while lower prices increase purchasing power, boosting demand.  

### 🍦 Demand Schedule for Ice Cream Cones  
| **Price per Cone (RM)** | **Quantity Demanded** |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |

- **Observation**: As price increases, quantity demanded decreases, reflecting the **law of demand**.  
- **Graphical Representation**: The **demand curve** slopes **downward** from left to right, showing an inverse price-quantity relationship.  

### 🧮 Demand Function  
- **Definition**: *The demand function shows the relationship between quantity demanded and various factors.*  
- **Mathematical Form**:  
  $$ Q_d = f(P, RP, Y, T, \ldots) $$  
  - $Q_d$: Quantity demanded.  
  - $P$: Price of the good.  
  - $RP$: Prices of related goods (substitutes or complements).  
  - $Y$: Income.  
  - $T$: Preferences and tastes of individuals.  
- **Implication**: Demand is multifaceted, influenced by price and non-price factors.  

### 🔄 Movements vs. Shifts in Demand  
- **Movements Along the Demand Curve**:  
  - Caused by **changes in the product’s own price**.  
  - Example: If ice cream price increases from **RM 1.50 to RM 2.00**, quantity demanded decreases from **60 to 40 cones**.  
- **Shifts of the Demand Curve**:  
  - Caused by **changes in non-price determinants**.  
  - **Rightward Shift (Increase in Demand)**:  
    - Example: Income doubles (e.g., from RM 5,000 to RM 10,000), increasing demand for ice cream cones.  
    - **Graphical Impact**: Curve shifts right, indicating higher demand at each price.  
  - **Leftward Shift (Decrease in Demand)**:  
    - Example: Price of a related good (e.g., chocolates) drops, reducing ice cream demand.  
    - **Graphical Impact**: Curve shifts left, indicating lower demand at each price.

## 📏 4. Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)  

### 📉 What is Price Elasticity?  
- **Definition**: *Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in the price of a good or service.*  
- **Purpose**: Quantifies how sensitive consumers are to price changes.  
- **Formula**:  
  $$ \text{PED} = \frac{\% \text{ change in quantity demanded}}{\% \text{ change in price}} $$  
- **Example**: If price increases by **10%** and quantity demanded decreases by **20%**:  
  $$ \text{PED} = \frac{-20\%}{10\%} = -2 $$  

### 🔍 Interpreting PED  
- **PED = -0.5 (Inelastic)**:  
  - Price increases by **10%**, quantity demanded decreases by **5%**.  
  - Example: Price rises from RM 1.00 to RM 1.10, apple demand falls from 100 to 95.  
  - For a **50%** price increase, quantity demanded decreases by **25%**.  
- **PED = -1.0 (Unit Elastic)**:  
  - Price increases by **10%**, quantity demanded decreases by **10%**.  
  - Example: Price rises from RM 1.00 to RM 1.10, apple demand falls from 100 to 90.  
  - For a **20%** price increase, quantity demanded decreases by **20%**.  
- **PED = -2.0 (Elastic)**:  
  - Price increases by **10%**, quantity demanded decreases by **20%**.  
  - Example: Price rises from RM 1.00 to RM 1.10, apple demand falls from 100 to 80.  
  - For a **20%** price increase, quantity demanded decreases by **40%**.  

### 📊 Types of Price Elasticity  
| **Elasticity Type**     | **PED Value** | **Description**                                             | **Examples**                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Elastic**             | > 1           | Large change in quantity demanded relative to price change. | Luxury cars, branded goods                             |
| **Inelastic**           | < 1           | Small change in quantity demanded relative to price change. | Essentials (salt, insulin)                             |
| **Unit Elastic**        | = 1           | Proportional change in quantity and price.                  | 20% price increase reduces demand by 20%               |
| **Perfectly Elastic**   | → ∞           | Slightest price increase reduces demand to zero.            | Perfect substitutes (e.g., identical products at RM 5) |
| **Perfectly Inelastic** | = 0           | Quantity demanded unchanged despite price changes.          | Life-saving drugs, salt (if affordable)                |
- **Perfectly Elastic Demand Curve**: Horizontal line at the market price (e.g., RM 5), where elasticity is **infinite**.  
- **Perfectly Inelastic Demand Curve**: Vertical line at a fixed quantity, where elasticity is **zero** (rare, e.g., essential medicines within affordability).  

### 🌟 Why Use Elasticity?  
- **Unit-Free Measure**: Enables comparison across markets without standardizing units.  
- **Applications**:  
  - Informs **pricing strategies** in healthcare and other sectors.  
  - Predicts consumer behavior in response to price changes.

  - **Source**: Sauerborn et al. (1994). *The Elasticity of Demand for Health Care in Burkina Faso*. *Health Policy and Planning*, 9, 185–192.  
- **Key Concerns**:  
  1. **Underuse in Developing Countries**: Healthcare is already **seriously underused** (e.g., 0.31 contacts per capita per year in rural Burkina Faso, mostly for serious illnesses). Price increases exacerbate untreated conditions.  
  2. **Frivolous Demand**: Raising prices to curb unnecessary demand is irrelevant in resource-constrained settings where demand is driven by **serious illnesses**.  
  3. **Equity Issues**: Price increases disproportionately affect **children** and **low-income groups**, reinforcing pre-existing inequities in access.  
  4. **Health Impacts on Children**: Reduced utilization leads to:  
     - **Progression of untreated illnesses**.  
     - **Missed immunizations**, creating **negative externalities** for the community.

## 🔄 5. Cross Elasticity of Demand (CED)  

### 📏 What is Cross Elasticity?  
- **Definition**: *Cross elasticity of demand (CED) measures the change in quantity demanded of one good in response to a change in the price of another good.*  
- **Formula**:  
  $$ \text{CED}_{AB} = \frac{\% \text{ change in quantity demanded of } A}{\% \text{ change in price of } B} $$  

### 🔍 Interpreting CED  
- **Substitutes Example**: Apples (A) and oranges (B).  
  - **CED_{AO} = 0.5**:  
    - Orange price increases by **10%**, apple demand increases by **5%**.  
    - Example: Orange price rises from RM 1.00 to RM 1.10, apple demand rises from 100 to 105.  
- **Complements Example**: Ink cartridges (C) and printers (P).  
  - **CED_{CP} = -0.5**:  
    - Printer price increases by **10%**, cartridge demand decreases by **5%**.  
    - Example: Printer price rises from RM 1,000 to RM 1,100, cartridge demand falls from 100 to 95.  

### 🛍️ Types of Goods  
| **Type**              | **CED Sign** | **Description**                    | **Examples**                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Substitute Goods**  | Positive     | Goods that can replace each other. | Apples and oranges, Coke and Sprite, butter and margarine, cakes and chocolates |
| **Complement Goods**  | Negative     | Goods consumed together.           | Printers and cartridges, shavers and blades, glucose monitors and strips        |
| **Independent Goods** | Near Zero    | Goods with unrelated consumption.  | Flowers and radios, shoes and tables, durians and apples                        |

### 🩺 CED in Healthcare: Malaysia (1975 Study)  
- **Study**: Heller (1982). *A Model of the Demand for Medical and Health Services in Peninsular Malaysia*. *Social Science & Medicine*, 16, 267–284.  
- **Findings**:  
  - **Outpatient Care**: Highly **inelastic** to cash price (PED = -0.04).  
  - **Substitution Effects**:  
    - **Public vs. Private Clinics**: Cross elasticity of demand for public care due to private care price changes is **+0.15**.  
    - **Traditional vs. Western Care**: Cross elasticity of demand for traditional care due to western care price changes is **+0.05**.  
  - **Additional Insights**:  
    - Consumers are sensitive to **relative prices** of alternative healthcare sources.  
    - **Time costs** (travel and treatment time) reduce demand for services.  
  - **Note**: Data from 1975; interpret cautiously due to changes in healthcare systems.

## 📦 6. Dynamics of Supply  

### 🏭 Understanding Supply  
- **Perspective**: From the **seller’s or firm’s viewpoint**.  
- **Definition**: *Supply is the amount of a product that sellers are willing and able to sell over a period of time.*  
- **Key Determinants**:  
  - **Price** of the product (primary factor).  
  - **Non-price factors**: Costs of production (e.g., raw materials like sugar, eggs, milk), prices of related goods, technology, and preferences.  

### 🍦 Supply Schedule for Ice Cream Cones  
| **Price per Cone (RM)** | **Quantity Supplied** |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| 0.50                    | 0                     |
| 1.00                    | 100                   |
| 1.50                    | 200                   |
| 2.00                    | 300                   |
| 2.50                    | 400                   |
| 3.00                    | 500                   |
- **Observation**: As price increases, quantity supplied increases, reflecting the **law of supply**.  
- **Graphical Representation**: The **supply curve** slopes **upward**, showing a direct price-quantity relationship.  

### ⚖️ Law of Supply  
- **Statement**: *Other things being equal, when the price of a product rises, the quantity supplied rises, and when the price falls, the quantity supplied falls.*  
- **Intuition**: Higher prices incentivize producers to supply more, while lower prices reduce supply incentives.  

### 🧮 Supply Function  
- **Definition**: *The supply function shows the relationship between quantity supplied and various factors.*  
- **Mathematical Form**:  
  $$ Q_s = f(P, RP, C, T, \ldots) $$  
  - $Q_s$: Quantity supplied.  
  - $P$: Price of the good.  
  - $RP$: Prices of related goods.  
  - $C$: Costs of production (e.g., milk, sugar, eggs for ice cream).  
  - $T$: Technology or preferences.  
- **Example**: A decrease in **production costs** (e.g., price of sugar, eggs, and milk drops by half) shifts the supply curve **right**, increasing supply.  

### 🔄 Shifts in Supply  
- **Shifts of the Supply Curve**:  
  - Caused by **changes in non-price factors**.  
  - **Rightward Shift (Increase in Supply)**:  
    - Example: Lower costs of raw materials (e.g., sugar, eggs, milk) increase ice cream supply.  
    - **Graphical Impact**: Curve shifts right, indicating higher supply at each price.  
  - **Leftward Shift (Decrease in Supply)**:  
    - Example: Higher ingredient costs or production disruptions reduce supply.

## 🌟 8. Perfectly Competitive Market  

### 📋 Characteristics  
- **Many Small Firms and Customers**: No single entity can influence the market price.  
- **Identical Products**: Customers are indifferent to which firm they buy from (e.g., identical ice cream cones).  
- **Freedom of Entry and Exit**: No barriers prevent firms from entering or leaving the market.  
- **Perfect Information**: Firms and customers are fully informed about products and prices.  

### ❓ Why Study Perfect Competition?  
- **Efficiency**: *Under perfect competition, the market mechanism performs best.*  
  - **Adam Smith**: Perfectly competitive firms use **society’s scarce resources** with **maximum efficiency**.  
  - **Friedrich Engels**: Ensures production aligns with **customer preferences** in variety and quantity.  
- **Benchmark**: Serves as an ideal model for understanding market efficiency, though rare in practice.  

### 📈 Supply Curve in Perfect Competition  
- **Horizontal Supply Curve**:  
  - A firm’s output is so **small** it cannot affect the **market price**.  
  - Firms can sell as much as they want at the **prevailing market price**.  
- **Graphical Representation**:  
  - **Market Supply Curve**: Upward sloping, reflecting total supply.  
  - **Firm’s Supply Curve**: Horizontal at the market price, as firms are **price takers**.  
- **Implication**: Firms accept the market price without influence.

## ⚖️ 9. Supply and Demand Equilibrium  

### 📖 What is Equilibrium?  
- **Definition**: *Equilibrium is a situation where the price reaches a level where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded.*  
- **Mathematical Condition**:  
  $$ Q_d = Q_s $$  
- **Outcome**: No **shortages** or **surpluses** in a competitive market; price stabilizes at the **equilibrium price**.  

### 🍦 Equilibrium Example: Ice Cream Cone Market  
- **Equilibrium Analysis**:  

| **Price (RM)** | **Quantity Demanded** | **Quantity Supplied** | **Market State** |
| -------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| 2.00           | 300                   | 300                   | Equilibrium      |
| 2.50           | 200                   | 400                   | Surplus (200)    |
| 1.50           | 400                   | 200                   | Shortage (200)   |

- **Scenarios**:  
  - **Price = RM 2.50**: Excess supply (**surplus of 200 cones**) leads to price reduction.  
  - **Price = RM 1.50**: Excess demand (**shortage of 200 cones**) leads to price increase.  
  - **Price = RM 2.00**: Market clears with **equilibrium quantity of 300 cones**.  

### 🔄 Effects of Shifts on Equilibrium  
- **Increase in Supply** (rightward shift):  
  - **Lower equilibrium price**, **higher equilibrium quantity**.  
  - Example: Cheaper raw materials (e.g., sugar, eggs, milk) increase ice cream supply, shifting the supply curve right.  
- **Increase in Demand** (rightward shift):  
  - **Higher equilibrium price**, **higher equilibrium quantity**.  
  - Example: Rising consumer income boosts ice cream demand, shifting the demand curve right.

### 📚 McKeown’s Thesis  
- **Context**: Thomas McKeown analyzed the **dramatic population growth** in England and Wales from around 1770 to the 20th century.  
- **Source**: McKeown, T. (1967). *The Modern Rise of Population*. New York: Academic Press.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - **Population Growth**: Primarily due to a **decline in mortality** rather than in-migration or increased fertility rates 🚼.  
  - **Mortality Decline**: Most prominent for **infectious diseases**, especially **airborne infections** (e.g., tuberculosis, bronchitis, pneumonia, influenza) 😷.  
  - **Timeline**:  
    - 1838–1970: Decline in **tuberculosis (TB) mortality** in England and Wales.  
    - 1882: Koch identifies the **TB bacillus**.  
    - 1940s: Introduction of **streptomycin** (antibiotic for TB).  
    - 1953: **BCG immunization** for all children.  
  - **Conclusions**:  
    - **Medical Technology**: Played a **minimal role** in mortality decline 🩺.  
    - **Public Health Measures**: Important but not the major contributor (e.g., immunizations, clean water supplies, sewage systems) 💉.  
    - **Rising Standards of Living**: The **most important factor**, enhancing **nutritional status** that led to increased **disease resistance** 🍽️.

| **Role of Medical Technology**| Minimal                                                                    |
| **Role of Public Health**     | Important but not the primary contributor                                  |
| **Key Driver**                | Improved living standards, especially nutrition, enhancing disease resistance|

### 📈 Contribution of Healthcare to Health  
- **Total Contribution**:  
  - History shows that over long periods, **curative medical care** may not have been the most significant factor in health improvements.  
- **Marginal Contribution**:  
  - Recent evidence highlights that **adequate access to healthcare** significantly extends life expectancy, particularly in older populations.  
  - **Example (China Study)**:  
    - At age 65: **Adequate access to healthcare** increased life expectancy by approximately **2.0–2.5 years** in men and women, across urban-rural areas, compared to those with inadequate access 🧓.  
    - At age 85: The corresponding increase was **1.0–1.2 years**.  
    - **Source**: Hao, L., et al. (2020). *Adequate access to healthcare and added life expectancy among older adults in China*. *BMC Geriatrics*, 20(1), 129. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-01524-9.  
- **Conclusion**: The **relationship between consumption of healthcare and improved health** leads to the **demand for healthcare** 🔄.

## ❤️ 4. Demand for Health and Healthcare  

### ⚖️ Rational Decision-Making  
- **Main Assumptions**:  
  - Consumers have the **ability to judge** based on **information** about:  
    - **Costs of consumption** (e.g., price, time, and other costs).  
    - **Benefits of consumption** (e.g., health improvements).  
  - **Costs and benefits** are borne by the consumer.  
  - Consumers make decisions to:  
    - **Consume or not consume** a service.  
    - If consuming, decide **how much to consume**.  
- **Decision Logic**:  
  - **Axiom of Completeness**: Consumers can **order preferences** 🧾.  
  - **Axiom of Transitivity**: If bundle $A$ is preferred to $B$, and $B$ to $C$, then $A$ is preferred to $C$.  
  - **Axiom of Selection**: Consumers choose the **most preferred state**.  
- **Expected Utility Theory**:  
  - Consumers can judge **costs and benefits** under **conditions of uncertainty** using the concept of **risk**.  
  - Only **consequences (outcomes)** matter, not the process of decision-making.  
  - Assumes **separation of consumption and production**.  

### 🚨 Special Nature of Healthcare  
- **Unique Characteristics**:  
  - **Health information is highly technical**, making it difficult for consumers to judge **costs and benefits**.  
  - Consumers may **relinquish decisions** to **healthcare professionals**.  
  - **Healthcare professionals (suppliers)** can **directly or indirectly influence** the consumption (demand) of healthcare.  
  - **Supplier and consumer roles** cannot be fully separated.  
- **Externalities in Health**:  
  - **Costs and benefits** are not only borne by the consumer but also affect **society**.  
  - **Resultant utility** extends beyond consumption of care to include:  
    - **Fair distribution** (equity).  
    - **Passing on difficult decision-making** to professionals.  

### 📜 Grossman’s Theory of Health Demand  
- **Source**: Grossman, M. (1972). *On the Concept of Health Capital and the Demand for Health*. *Journal of Political Economy*, 80, 223–255.  
- **Core Proposition**:  
  - **Health** is a **durable capital stock** that produces an output of **healthy time** 👤.  
  - Individuals inherit an **initial stock of health** that:  
    - **Depreciates** with age (potentially at a non-constant rate).  
    - Can be **increased** by investment (e.g., healthcare, lifestyle choices).  
- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Individuals act as both **consumers** and **producers** of health.  
  - The **idea of the individual as a producer** concerns how they **allocate resources** (time and money) to produce health.  
  - **Investing in human capital** (health and education) improves outcomes in:  
    - **Market sectors** (e.g., work productivity).  
    - **Non-market sectors** (e.g., household roles).  
  - **Shadow Price of Health**: Depends on variables beyond medical care costs, such as:  
    - **Age**: Rises if the **depreciation rate** of health increases over the life cycle.  
    - **Education**: Falls if more educated people are **more efficient producers** of health.  
  - **Implication**: An increase in the shadow price may **simultaneously reduce the quantity of health demanded** and **increase the quantity of medical care demanded**.  

#### **Key Principles of Demand**  
- **Derived Demand**:  
  - **Demand for healthcare** is derived from the **demand for health** 💡.  
  - **Demand for health** is derived from the **demand for utility**.  
- **Active Role**:  
  - Individuals are **not passive consumers** but **active producers** who spend **time and money** on the production of health.  
- **Health as Capital**:  
  - Health **lasts over time periods**, **depreciates**, and can be analyzed as a **capital good** 🔄.

## ⚙️ 6. Influencing Demand for Healthcare  

### 📋 Overview  
Demand for healthcare can be influenced through:  
- **Supply-Side Measures**: Factors related to **providers of care**, such as the **number and distribution of facilities** and **doctors** 🏥.  
- **Demand-Side Measures**: Factors related to **individual choices**, such as **disposable income**, **education**, and **preferences** 🛍️.  

### 🩺 Role of Payment Mechanisms  
- **Key Idea**: *Demand for healthcare can be affected by the manner in which healthcare services are paid.*  
- **Mechanisms**:  
  - **Supply-Side Measures**: Changing **provider behavior** through different **payment mechanisms**.  
  - **Demand-Side Measures**: Changing **patient behavior** through the impact of **third-party payers** such as insurance companies.  

---

## 💰 7. Provider Payment Mechanisms  

### 📖 Overview  
Provider payment mechanisms vary by the **unit of payment**, ranging from **simple** (e.g., payment per procedure) to **complex/aggregated** (e.g., payment for a year’s services). These methods impact **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** for **doctors** and **hospitals**.

#### **Fee-for-Service (FFS)**  
- **Definition**: *Provider receives a fee for every service given.*  
- **Example**: If a patient is seen by a GP, has a chest X-ray, and receives an injection, the GP receives a **consultation fee**, a **fee for the CXR**, and a **fee for the injection** 🩺.  
- **Potential Impact**: Affects **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** for doctors and hospitals.  
- **Incentives**:  
  - **Beneficial**:  
    - Patients are likely to receive **optimal level and quality of care**.  
    - Patients requiring **complex treatment** are not likely to be denied care.  
  - **Adverse**:  
    - **Provider-Induced Demand (PID)**: Providers may over-provide services to increase income due to financial incentives 🤝.  
- **Principal-Agent Relationship**:  
  - **Principal**: Patient.  
  - **Agent**: Provider.  
  - **Principal-Agent Problem**: Due to **asymmetry of information**, the principal may not be able to ensure that the agent is acting in their **best interest**, especially if provision is linked to increased income.  

#### **Per Diem Payment**  
- **Definition**: *Hospital receives one fixed payment that covers all services delivered to one patient for one day.*  
- **Example**: Mr. ABC is admitted for pneumonia, and Mr. DEF is admitted for backache; both are discharged after one day. The hospital receives the **same payment** for both, regardless of the type and quantity of services received 🛏️.  
- **Potential Impact**: Affects **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** for hospitals.  
- **Incentives**:  
  - **Providers have incentives to provide less in a day**, as payment is the same regardless of the quantity or quality of services provided.  
  - **May prolong the period of hospitalization**, as longer admissions lead to more payments, potentially driving up **costs**.  
  - **Quality of care may be affected** due to reduced services per day.  

#### **Case-Based Payment**  
- **Definition**: *Provider receives a predetermined fee that covers all services per case or episode of illness, which may require more than a day’s treatment.*  
- **Examples**: **Maternity package** (bundling ante-, intra-, and postpartum care), **Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs)** 🧾.  
- **Potential Impact**: Affects **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** for hospitals.  
- **Incentives**:  
  - **Providers have a strong incentive to contain costs per case**.  
  - **Over-treatment and unnecessary interventions** are unlikely.  
  - **Patients potentially may receive less than optimal care**, as providers may reduce the **quantity and quality of treatment** since payment is based on diagnosis.  

#### **Capitation**  
- **Definition**: *Provider receives a fee for all services provided to one patient, usually for a period of time (e.g., the entire year).*  
- **Example**: A GP in the United Kingdom receives one fee from the NHS to look after all the healthcare needs of one patient 👨‍⚕️.  
- **Potential Impact**: Affects **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** for doctors.  
- **Incentives**:  
  - **Providers have a strong incentive to contain costs per case**.  
  - **Over-treatment and unnecessary interventions** are unlikely.  
  - **Adverse selection of patients**: Doctors may turn away **sick patients** who cost more to treat.  

#### **Salary**  
- **Definition**: *Provider receives a fixed fee for all the services provided in one month, regardless of the number of patients or services provided.*  
- **Potential Impact**: Affects **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** for doctors.  
- **Incentives**:  
  - **Patients are unlikely to be denied needed care**.  
  - **Doctors lack incentive to contain costs**, which may drive up costs.  
  - **Lack incentive to be productive**, potentially lowering efficiency 📅.

## 🛡️ 8. Insurance and Moral Hazard  

### 📖 What is Insurance?  
- **Definition**: *Insurance is a prepayment into a common fund that pays providers for future healthcare needs, protecting the patient against financial loss.*  
- **Key Feature**: **Insured individuals** do not bear the full **financial risk** if they fall ill and require healthcare, as they **do not need to pay more** at the point of service 💸.  

### 💰 Financial Risk and Third-Party Payers  
- **Effect of Third-Party Payers**:  
  - **Insured do not pay directly for the full cost of care**, with costs covered by **insurers** or other payers.  
  - This reduces **financial barriers**, leading to **increased demand** and **higher system costs**.  
- **Moral Hazard Effect**: A significant consequence of third-party payment systems.  

### ⚠️ Moral Hazard  
- **Definition**: *Moral hazard occurs when a party insulated from risk behaves differently than it would behave if it were fully exposed to the risk.*  
- **Applying to Health Insurance**:  
  - The **existence of insurance cover** changes the behavior of the insured because they no longer have to bear the **full financial risk** when consuming healthcare services.  
  - In most instances, this **increases the use of healthcare services** and thus **increases costs** ❗.  

### 🔄 Mechanisms of Moral Hazard  
- **Change of Behavior**:  
  - Insured individuals may indulge in **risky behaviors** (e.g., drink driving, risky sexual behaviors).  
- **Information Asymmetry**:  
  - Insured may withhold information on **past medical conditions** (e.g., past history of myocardial infarct).  
- **Decreased Payment at Point of Usage**:  
  - Since **payment is made by insurers** and not patients, patients have **no incentives to control use and control costs**.  
  - This is **less likely to apply when demand is inelastic** (e.g., essential treatments).  

### 📉 Moral Hazard and Demand Types  
- **Inelastic Demand**:  
  - **Example**: Insulin for treatment of **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus**.  
  - **Quantity does not change with price**, leading to **no appreciable moral hazard**.  
- **Elastic Demand**:  
  - **Example**: GP visits for a fever.  
  - **Without Insurance**:  
    - Patients need to pay **price $P_1$**, resulting in **demand of $Q_1$ visits**.  
  - **With Insurance**:  
    - **No payment up front** (marginal price = 0, as the price is paid by the insurer).  
    - **Price = 0**, increasing **demand to $Q_2$ visits**.  
  - **Graphical Representation**:  
    - The demand curve shifts right as the effective price drops to zero, reflecting increased consumption due to reduced cost barriers.  

#### **Table: Elastic vs. Inelastic Demand**  
| **Demand Type** | **Example**                          | **Moral Hazard Risk** |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| **Inelastic**   | Insulin for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus | Low                   |
| **Elastic**     | GP visits for mild fever             | High                  |
- **Note**: Elastic demand is **more sensitive to price changes**, making it more prone to **moral hazard**.  

### 📋 Terminology in Health Insurance  
| **Term**         | **Definition**                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Premium**      | Amount paid for specified coverage.                                                                                        |
| **Coverage**     | Specified benefits that can be obtained.                                                                                   |
| **Cost Sharing** | Sharing of costs between insured and insurer.                                                                              |
| **Deductible**   | Shared payment specified as fixed amounts paid by insured over a period of time (e.g., a year) before insurer cost-shares. |
| **Coinsurance**  | Shared payment specified as a percentage of costs.                                                                         |
| **Copayments**   | Fixed amount needed to be paid each time before insured receives care.                                                     |

### 🌐 Other Third-Party Payers  
- **Employers**:  
  - Employees may be covered under **employment benefits**.  
  - Companies may **self-insure** or **purchase insurance coverage**.  
  - **Similar moral hazard issues** as direct health insurance apply 🏢.  
- **Government**:  
  - Provides **public provision and financing of healthcare**.  
  - **Moral hazard issues still exist** due to reduced patient costs at the point of service 🏛️.  

### 🛠️ Mechanisms to Overcome Moral Hazard  
- **Problem**: **Moral hazard will lead to higher insurance pay-outs** due to increased healthcare utilization.  
- **Solution**: Ensure that **care is no longer free at the point of usage** to align patient incentives with cost control.  
- **Mechanisms**:  
  - **Copayments**: Fixed amount paid per visit.  
  - **Coinsurance**: Percentage-based cost sharing (e.g., 20% of costs).  
  - **Deductibles**: Fixed amounts paid by the insured over a period before insurer cost-shares.  
- **Purpose**: Encourage **responsible consumption** and reduce overuse 🔐.

## 📈 6. Analyzing Health Expenditures  

### 🔍 Basics of Financing: Understanding Expenditures  
- **Key Question**: *How do you know what a country spends on healthcare?*  
- **Challenges**:  
  - Comparing expenditures across **time** requires adjusting for **inflation**.  
  - Comparing across **countries** requires adjusting for **currency differences** and **purchasing power**.  

#### **Time Value of Money**  
- **Question**: *Is a dollar today worth a dollar tomorrow?*  
- **Answer**: No, due to **inflation** and the **time value of money**.  
  - A unit of currency is **worth more now** than in the future.  
  - A unit of currency is **worth less now** than in the past.  

#### **Adjusting for Inflation**  
- **Need**: Expenditures must be adjusted for **inflation** to ensure comparability over time.  
- **Tools**:  
  - **Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Deflators**: Adjusts for economy-wide price changes.  
  - **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: Measures changes in consumer goods prices.  
- **Example**: Total Health Expenditure (THE) in Malaysia (1997–2021):  

| **Year**     | **THE (Current RM)** | **THE (Adjusted to 2021 RM)** |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1997         | RM 8.6 billion       | RM 18.3 billion               |
| 2021         | RM 78.2 billion      | RM 78.2 billion               |
| **Increase** | 809% (current)       | 380% (adjusted)               |

- **Calculation (Base Year 2021)**:  
  - For 1997:  
    $$ \text{Constant 1997 THE} = \frac{111.4 \times 8.6}{52.1} = \text{RM 18.4 billion} $$  
  - For 2010:  
    $$ \text{Constant 2010 THE} = \frac{111.4 \times 32.9}{90.4} = \text{RM 40.5 billion} $$  
  - **GDP Deflators**: 1997 (52.1), 2010 (90.4), 2021 (111.4).  
- **Inflation Rate Example (2020–2024)**:  
  - Price of a burger: RM 6.00 (2020), RM 6.60 (2024).  
  - $$ \text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{6.60 - 6.00}{6.00} = 10\% $$  
- **Source**: Malaysia National Health Accounts, Health Expenditure Reports (various years).  

#### **Cross-Country Comparisons**  
- **Question**: *Can a dollar buy the same amount of goods in every country?*  
- **Challenges**:  
  - **Different currencies**.  
  - **Different purchasing power** of currencies.  
- **Adjustments**:  
  - **Official Currency Exchange Rates**: Convert to a common currency (e.g., USD).  
  - **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Rates**: Reflects real purchasing power.  
- **Example**: National Health Expenditures (2022, per capita):  

| **Country** | **Per Capita CHE (Currency Rate, USD)** | **Per Capita CHE (PPP Rate, USD)** | **Currency** |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------ |

## 💵 7. Modalities of Health Care Financing  

### 📋 Overview  
Countries use a **combination of financing modalities**, differing in their **relative proportions**. The main modalities include:  
- General taxation  
- Social insurance  
- Private insurance  
- Out-of-pocket (OOP) payments  
- Others: Medical Savings Accounts, Community Health Financing  

#### **General Taxation**  
- **Definition**: *Funds collected through direct (e.g., income tax) or indirect (e.g., sales tax) taxes to finance social programs like health and education.*  
- **Categories**:  
  - **Direct Taxes**: E.g., income tax.  
  - **Indirect Taxes**: E.g., sales tax on goods and services.  
- **Advantages**:  
  - **Progressive Taxation**:  
    - **Progressive Tax System**: *Taxes rise as a proportion of income as income rises.*  
    - **Regressive Tax System**: *Taxes fall as a proportion of income as income rises.*  
    - **Proportional System**: *Taxes are the same proportion of income for all, irrespective of income.*  
    - **Example**:  
      - Mr. A: Pays RM 100 for healthcare, earns RM 1,000/month (10% of income).  
      - Mr. B: Pays RM 200 for healthcare, earns RM 4,000/month (5% of income).  
      - **Analysis**: This is **regressive**, as the lower-income individual pays a higher proportion.  
  - **Social Justice**:  
    - Acts as an **instrument** to achieve equitable wealth distribution.  
    - Supports **vulnerable groups** (e.g., poor, elderly).  
    - Funds **public goods** (non-rivalrous, non-excludable, e.g., lighthouses, health information, clean air) and **merit goods** (under-consumed by market, e.g., vaccines, vector control, screening programs).  
  - **Political Will**: Required for progressive implementation.  
- **Disadvantages**:  
  - **Revenue Variability**: Depends on:  
    - **Wealth of the country**.  
    - **Taxable base**.  
    - **Competition** with other national needs (e.g., defense).  
    - **Fluctuates** year to year.  
  - **Inadequate Funds**: May not meet healthcare demands.  
  - **Reliance on Indirect Taxes**: Often **regressive**, burdening the poor and those less able to pay.  
- **Examples**:  
  - **Hospital Authority** in Hong Kong.  
  - **Public health services** in Malaysia.  

#### **Health Insurance**

## 📚 1. Introduction and Recap on Health Financing  

**Health insurance** and **managed care** are critical mechanisms for financing healthcare, addressing **cost control**, **equity**, and **access** to services. This lecture builds on health financing principles, exploring **insurance systems**, **managed care strategies**, and their role in achieving **universal health coverage (UHC)**.

### 🔍 Recap on Health Financing  
- **Functions of Health Financing**:  
  - **Revenue Collection**: Mobilizing funds from households, organizations, and donors.  
  - **Fund Pooling**: Accumulating and managing revenue to share financial risks.  
  - **Purchasing of Services**: Allocating funds to providers for healthcare delivery.  
- **Main Financing Modalities**:  
  - **General Taxation**: Public funding through direct (e.g., income tax) or indirect (e.g., sales tax) taxes.  
  - **Health Insurance**: Includes social and private insurance schemes.  
  - **Out-of-Pocket (OOP) Payments**: Direct payments by individuals to providers.  
- **Impact on Distribution**:  
  - Each modality affects **who bears the cost** of healthcare, influencing **equity** and **access**.  
- **National Health Accounts (NHAs)**:  
  - *A set of descriptive accounts tracking the totality of expenditure flows in government and non-government sectors.*  
  - Answers: *Who paid, who did they pay to, and what did they get for their payment? How are resources used, for what services, and for whom?*  
  - Provides **evidence** for policymakers, stakeholders, and managers to improve **health system performance**.  

### ❓ Why Distribution Matters  
- **Equity Implications**: The distribution of health expenditures determines whether costs disproportionately burden the **poor** or **rich**, affecting **access** and **financial protection**.  
- **Key Question**: *Does the distribution of health expenditures exacerbate inequalities?*

---

## ⚖️ 2. Equity in Health Expenditures  

### 📈 Out-of-Pocket (OOP) Concentration Curve  
- **Definition**: *Plots the cumulative proportion of OOP health payments against the cumulative proportion of the population ranked by socioeconomic status (SES).*  
- **Purpose**: Visualizes **inequality** in the burden of OOP payments across income groups.  
- **Graphical Representation**:  
  - **X-Axis**: Cumulative proportion of population, from **poorest** to **richest**.  
  - **Y-Axis**: Cumulative proportion of **OOP payments**.  
  - **Diagonal (Line of Equality)**: Represents perfect equity, where OOP payments are proportional to population share.  
- **Examples**:  
  - **Above Diagonal**: Poorest 50% of the population account for **75% of total OOP payments**, indicating **inequality where the poor bear a greater share**.  
  - **Below Diagonal**: Poorest 50% account for **25% of total OOP payments**, indicating **inequality where the rich bear a greater share**.  
- **Interpretation**:  
  - **Further from Diagonal**: Greater **inequality**.  
  - **Above Diagonal**: **Poor** bear a **disproportionately higher burden** (regressive).  
  - **Below Diagonal**: **Rich** bear a **disproportionately higher burden** (progressive).  
  - **On Diagonal**: **Perfect equity**.  
- **Table: OOP Concentration Curve Interpretation**  

| **Curve Position** | **Implication**                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Above Diagonal     | Poor bear more OOP burden (regressive)  |
| Below Diagonal     | Rich bear more OOP burden (progressive) |
| On Diagonal        | Perfect equity                          |

### 📊 Concentration Index (CI)  
- **Definition**: *A measurement technique that summarizes inequality in one figure, based on the concentration curve.*  
- **Calculation**: *Twice the area between the concentration curve and the line of equality.*  
  - **Formula**:  
    $$ \text{CI} = 2 \times \text{Area between curve and diagonal} $$  
- **Value Range**: From **-1** to **+1**.  
  - **CI < 0**: Inequality concentrated among the **poor** (closer to -1 indicates greater burden on the poor).  
  - **CI > 0**: Inequality concentrated among the **rich**.  
  - **CI = 0**: No correlation between OOP payments and **SES**, indicating **equity**.  
- **Source**: Khazanah Research Institute (2020). *Social Inequalities and Health in Malaysia. The State of Households 2020. Part III.*  

### 🚨 Catastrophic Health Payments  
- **Definition**: *OOP spending that exceeds a critical percentage of household resources, likely forcing cuts in essential consumption, asset sales, debt, or impoverishment.*  
- **Typical Thresholds**:  
  - **>10% of total household consumption**.  
  - **>40% of household capacity to pay** (income after essential expenses).  
- **Source**:  
  - Van Doorslaer, E., et al. (2007). *Catastrophic payments for health care in Asia.* *Health Economics*, 16, 1159–84.  
  - Wagstaff, A., et al. (2018). *Progress on catastrophic health spending in 133 countries.* *Lancet Global Health*, 6, e169–e179.  
- **Lack of Consensus**: Diverse thresholds indicate no universal agreement on defining catastrophic payments.  

### 📉 Poverty Impact of OOP Payments  
- **Purpose**: Examines whether OOP payments **push households into poverty** or deepen existing poverty.  
- **Indices**:  
  - **Poverty Headcount**: Proportion of individuals/households below the poverty line.  
  - **Poverty Due to OOP**: Difference in headcounts before and after deducting OOP payments from income.  
- **Global Poverty Lines**:  
  - **$2.15/day** (2017 PPP-adjusted).  
  - **Country-Specific**: E.g., 60% of median per capita consumption/income.  
- **Consequences**:  
  - **Impoverishment**: Pushes households below the poverty line.  
  - **Deterred Care-Seeking**: Financial barriers reduce access to needed services.  
  - **Negative Welfare Impact**: Deprives resources for essentials (e.g., food, education), especially for **poor families**.  
- **Sources**:  
  - Van Doorslaer, E., et al. (2006). *Effect of payments for health care on poverty estimates in 11 countries in Asia.* *Lancet*, 368, 1357–64.  
  - Wagstaff, A., et al. (2018). *Progress on impoverishing health spending in 122 countries.* *Lancet Global Health*, 6, e180–e192.  

### 📊 OOP Payments as % of Current Health Expenditure (CHE)  
- **Data**: Trends from 2000–2021 across income groups.  
- **Figure**:  
  - **High-Income Countries**: OOP payments decreased (e.g., ~15% of CHE in 2021).  
  - **Upper-Middle-Income**: ~30% of CHE.  
  - **Lower-Middle-Income**: ~38% of CHE.  
  - **Low-Income**: ~50% of CHE.  
- **Source**: World Health Organization Global Health Observatory Database, accessed 21st October 2024.  
- **Implication**: Higher OOP reliance in **low-income countries** increases **financial hardship** risks.

  - **Motivation**: Equity and universal coverage, not profit.  
- **PHI**:  
  - **Individually Risk-Rated**: *Premiums reflect the individual’s risk of falling ill.*  
  - **Example**: Higher premiums for **males**, **older individuals**, or those with **pre-existing conditions**.  
  - **Cherry Picking**: Encourages **low-risk** individuals to join, maximizing insurer profits.  

#### **Premium Payment**  
- **SHI**:  
  - **Contributions**: From **employer** and **employee** via **salary deductions** (wage-based for formal sector).  
  - **Informal Sector**: Various mechanisms (e.g., flat rates).  
  - **Government Assistance**: Subsidies for those unable to pay (e.g., **poor**, **elderly**, **unemployed**).  
- **PHI**:  
  - **Direct Payments**: By **individuals** (annually, from savings) or **employers** (as part of remuneration).  
  - **Employer Role**: May **self-insure** or purchase PHI for employees.  

#### **Fund Pooling**  
- **SHI**:  
  - *Pooling of risk through single or multiple funds, usually managed by quasi-government bodies.*  
  - **Advantages of Single/Few Funds**:  
    - **Greater risk pooling**.  
    - **Economies of scale**.  
  - **Role**: Funds act as **purchasers of care**.  
- **PHI**:  
  - *Generally smaller extent of pooling compared to SHI.*  
  - Focuses on **individual or group-level** risk management.  

#### **Benefit Packages**  
- **SHI**:  
  - *Designed to be comprehensive, regulated, and stipulated in a benefit package.*  
  - **Objective**: Meet **community health needs** rather than individual demands.  
  - **Content Selection**:

## ⚠️ 6. Moral Hazard in Health Insurance  

### 📖 What is Moral Hazard?  
- **Definition**: *Occurs when an individual insulated from risk behaves differently than they would if fully exposed to the risk.*  
- **In Health Insurance**:  
  - *Existence of insurance cover changes the behavior of the insured because they no longer bear the full financial risk when consuming healthcare services.*  
  - **Effect**: Increases use of healthcare services, raising **costs** and threatening **fund sustainability**.  

### 🛠️ Mechanisms to Manage Moral Hazard  
- **Problem**: *Moral hazard can lead to higher insurance payouts.*  
- **Solution**: Ensure care is **not free** at the point of use, balanced with **affordability** and **access** to needed care.  
- **Strategies**:  
  - **Copayments**: Fixed amounts paid per service.  
  - **Coinsurance**: Percentage of costs shared by the insured (e.g., 20%).  
  - **Deductibles**: Fixed amounts paid annually before insurer coverage begins.  

### 📋 Health Insurance Terminology  
| **Term**         | **Definition**                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Premium**      | Amount paid for specified coverage.                                                   |
| **Coverage**     | Specified benefits that can be obtained.                                              |
| **Cost-Sharing** | Sharing of costs between insured and insurer.                                         |
| **Deductible**   | Fixed amount paid by insured over a period (e.g., a year) before insurer cost-shares. |
| **Coinsurance**  | Percentage of costs shared by insured (e.g., 20%).                                    |

## 🧠 8. Managed Care: Concepts and Evolution  

### 📖 What is Managed Care?  
- **Definition**: *A set of techniques employed by third-party payers to control healthcare costs through control on use of healthcare services.*  
- **Reasons for Emergence**:  
  - **Inability of Insurers to Contain Costs**: Due to **moral hazard** and **perverse incentives** in provider payment mechanisms.  
  - **Escalating Healthcare Costs**: In the U.S., **Current Health Expenditure (CHE)** as a percentage of **GDP** increased from **12.5% in 2000 to 16.7% in 2022**.  

### 🧰 Managed Care Techniques  
- **Demand-Side Controls**:  
  - **Limit Patient Choice**: Restrict provider networks.  
  - **Primary Care Gatekeeping**: Emphasize primary care to reduce specialist referrals.  
  - **Encourage Prevention**: Promote cost-effective preventive services.  
- **Supply-Side Controls**:  
  - **Control Selection of Providers**: Restrict number and choice of providers.  
  - **Financial Risk-Sharing**: E.g., **fund holding by GPs**, **capitation**.  
  - **Peer Review and Quality Assurance**: Control unnecessary service use.  
- **Aim**: **Control costs and utilization** while maintaining care quality.  
- **Table: Managed Care Techniques**  

| **Demand-Side Controls** | **Supply-Side Controls**                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Limit patient choice     | Control selection of providers            |
| Primary care gatekeeping | Financial risk-sharing (e.g., capitation) |
| Encourage prevention     | Peer review and quality assurance         |

### ⚖️ Bearing Risks in Managed Care  
- **Purpose**: **Contain costs** by sharing **financial risks** with providers.  
- **Mechanism**:  
  - Incentives to change **provider behavior** (e.g., reduce unnecessary procedures).  
  - Most American **Managed Care Organizations (MCOs)** mandate **risk-sharing** with providers.  

### ❓ Ethical and Quality Concerns  
- **Conflicting Aims**:  
  - *Controlling utilization of care and improvement of quality.*  
- **Main Issue**: Risk of **minimizing care** to **maximize profits**.  
- **Neutral Techniques**:  
  - Tools like **primary care gatekeeping** or **provider risk-sharing** are not inherently problematic.  
  - *Fault lies in balancing the extent of use.*  

### 🏥 Types of Managed Care Organizations  
#### **Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)**  
- **Definition**: *A managed healthcare plan that provides or arranges comprehensive, coordinated medical services to voluntarily enrolled members on a prepaid basis.*  
- **Features**:  
  - Combines roles of **insurers** and **healthcare providers**.  
  - Delivers **comprehensive services**.  
  - **Voluntary enrollment**.  
  - **Fixed prepaid basis**.  

#### **Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs)**  
- **Definition**: *Loose arrangements between doctors and third-party payers.*  
- **Features**:  
  - Includes **discounted fee schedules**.  
  - **Restricts provider choices**.  
  - Similar to **panel doctors** in Malaysia.  

### 🇺🇸 Development in America  
- **Main Driver**: **Escalating healthcare costs** and failure of traditional insurance to contain them.  
- **Context**: U.S. healthcare costs rose significantly, necessitating cost-control measures.  

### 🇲🇾 Managed Care in Malaysia  
- **Development**: Evolved through **three generations** since the early 1980s:  

| **Generation** | **Model**                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1st Generation | Panel Doctor System        |
| 2nd Generation | Third-Party Administrators |
| 3rd Generation | Medical Card Companies     |

- **Key Differences from U.S.**:  
  - **Not Cost-Driven**: *Not mainly driven by need to contain costs unlike in America.*  
  - **Administrative Convenience**: *Administrative ease for employers to administer employee health benefits.*  
  - **Not Risk Bearers**: *Malaysian MCOs are not financial risk bearers.*  
  - **Consumer Demand**: *Currently, MCOs cater to consumer demands for screening programs, which may even drive up costs.*

## 🌐 9. Universal Health Coverage (UHC)  

### 📖 What is UHC?  
- **Definition**: *Ensuring that all people can use the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, and palliative health services they need, of sufficient quality to be effective, while ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the user to financial hardship.*  
  - **Source**: World Health Organization (2010). *World Health Report 2010. Financing for universal coverage.*  
- **Features**:  
  - **Whole Population Access**: Services available regardless of **income**, **social status**, or **residency**.  
  - **100% Coverage**: Same **scope of benefits** for all.  
- **Policy Objectives**:  
  - **Equity in Payment**: Fair contribution across income groups.  
  - **Financial Protection**: No financial hardship from healthcare costs.  
  - **Equity in Access and Utilization**: Services based on need, not ability to pay.  

### 💸 Financing for UHC  
- **Path to Universal Access**:  
  1. **Raising Sufficient Resources**: Mobilizing funds for health through taxation, insurance, or other means.  
  2. **Removing Financial Risks and Barriers**: Ensuring affordable access via risk pooling and prepayment.  
  3. **Promoting Efficiency and Reducing Waste**: Optimizing resource use to maximize health outcomes.  
  - [Note: Fourth step incomplete, likely includes policy alignment or governance].  
- **Source**: World Health Organization (2010). *World Health Report 2010.*  

### 🛡️ Financial Protection for Health  
- **Goal**: *Protecting individuals and families from excessive OOP payments.*  
- **Issues with High OOP Payments**:  
  - **Involuntary**: Often in response to unwanted health shocks.  
  - **Negative Welfare Impact**: Deprives resources for other goods and services, especially for **poor families**.  
  - **Deters Needed Services**: Financial barriers reduce access.  
- **Approaches to Assess OOP Impact**:  
  - **Catastrophic Health Payments**: Measures large expenses relative to household resources.  
  - **Poverty Impact**: Evaluates if OOP pushes households into poverty.  

### 📊 Global Trends in OOP Payments  
- **OOP as % of CHE (2000–2021)**:  
  - **High-Income Countries**: Declined to ~15% by 2021.  
  - **Upper-Middle-Income**: ~30%.  
  - **Lower-Middle-Income**: ~38%.  
  - **Low-Income**: ~50%.  
- **Implication**: Higher OOP reliance in **low-income countries** increases risks of **financial hardship**, **catastrophic payments**, and **impoverishment**.

### 📉 Quantifying Inequalities  
#### **Global Poor-Rich Infant Mortality Gap**  
- **Data**: Based on 45 developing countries (average IMR = 78) compared to industrialized countries (average IMR = 7).  
- **Source**: Slides developed by Abdo Yazbeck (World Bank).  
- **Table: Global Poor-Rich Infant Mortality Gap**  

| **Indicator**                                                                              | **Value**    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Actual annual infant deaths in 45 developing countries (Average IMR = 78)                  | 5.39 million |
| Estimated infant deaths in same countries at industrialized country rate (Average IMR = 7) | 0.48 million |
| Overall global poor-rich mortality gap (Actual - Estimated)                                | 4.91 million |

#### **Intra-Country Poor-Rich Infant Mortality Gap**  
- **Data**: Compares infant mortality across wealth deciles within the same 45 developing countries.  
- **Table: Intra-Country Poor-Rich Infant Mortality Gap**  

| **Indicator**                                                             | **Value**    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Actual annual infant deaths in 45 developing countries (Average IMR = 78) | 5.39 million |
| Estimated infant deaths at top wealth decile rate (Average IMR = 33)      | 2.28 million |
| Annual infant deaths prevented by eliminating intra-country poor-rich gap | 3.11 million |

#### **Contribution of Intra-Country Differences**  
- **Calculation**:  
  $$ \text{Percentage of global gap} = \frac{\text{Intra-country gap}}{\text{Global gap}} \times 100 = \frac{3.11}{4.91} \times 100 = 63\% $$

## ⚖️ 3. Equity in Health  

### ❓ Main Question  
- *When is an inequality in health an inequity?*  

### 🧾 Definitions  
- **Inequality**: *Observed differences in health outcomes or access to healthcare across groups.*  
- **Inequity**: *Differences in health which are unnecessary, avoidable, unjust, and unfair.*  
  - **Source**: Whitehead, M. (1991). *The concepts and principles of equity and health*.  
- **Key Criterion**: Inequities arise when differences are **avoidable** and stem from **lack of control** over health-promoting or health-damaging conditions.  
- **No Universal Consensus**: Determining what is **unjust** or **unfair** depends on societal values and context.  
- **Examples**:  
  - **Acceptable Inequality**: Men do not suffer from **cervical cancer**, but women do (biological).  
  - **Inequity**: Children from poor households have **less vaccination coverage** than those from richer households (avoidable, unjust).  

### ✅ Generally Fair Differences  
- Due to **biological variation** (e.g., gender-specific diseases like cervical or prostate cancer).  
- Due to **freely chosen health-damaging behavior** (e.g., smoking).  
- Due to **freely chosen health-promoting behavior** (e.g., regular exercise).  

### ❌ Generally Unfair Differences  
- Due to **health-damaging behavior** where **choice is limited** (e.g., exposure to poverty, poor living conditions).  
- Due to **exposures to unhealthy and stressful working and living conditions**.  
- Due to **inadequate access** to basic health and social services.  
- Due to **health-related social mobility** (e.g., illness leading to loss of income or status).  

### 🔗 Link to Health Services  
- **Key Insight**: *Inequities in health outcomes are often related to inequalities in the use of health services.*  
- **Example**: Lower access to **skilled birth attendance** in rural areas contributes to higher maternal and infant mortality.  

### ⚖️ Inverse Care Law  
- **Definition**: *“The availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the population served.”*  
  - **Source**: Hart, J.T. (1971). *The Lancet*, 27 February 1971.  
- **Observation**:  
  - **Higher-income groups** make **better use** of health services, receiving **more specialist attention**, occupying **better-equipped and staffed hospitals**, receiving **more elective surgery**, having **better maternal care**, and being **more likely to get psychiatric help and psychotherapy** than low-income groups, particularly the unskilled.  
  - **Lower-income groups**, despite greater health needs, receive **less care**.  
- **Implication**: This exacerbates **inequities**, as those with the **greatest need** face **barriers to access**.  

### 🧬 Case Study: Breast Cancer Incidence in the U.S. (1992–2005)  
- **Source**: Yazbeck, A.S. (2009). *Attacking inequality in the health sector: A synthesis of evidence and tools*. Washington, DC: The World Bank.  
- **Findings**:  
  - Between 1992 and 2005, the **rise and fall** in U.S. breast cancer incidence rates occurred **only among White non-Hispanic women** who:  
    - Lived in **high-income counties**.  
    - Were aged **50 years and older**.  
    - Had **estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors**.  
  - **No Similar Trends**: Among **Black non-Hispanic**, **Asian/Pacific Islander**, **Hispanic**, or **American Indian/Alaska Native women**.  
- **Conclusion**:  
  - The **decline in breast cancer incidence** was **not equally beneficial** to all women.  
  - It **mirrored the social patterning** of **hormone therapy use**, which was more prevalent among affluent White women, reflecting **inequity in access to interventions**.

## 🩺 4. Defining Health Equity  

### 📖 Health Equity  
- **Definition**: *The absence of systematic disparities in health (or its social determinants) between more or less advantaged social groups.*  
  - **Source**: Braveman, P., & Gruskin, S. (2003). *Defining equity in health*.  
- **Social Advantage**: Defined by **wealth**, **power**, and/or **prestige**, which shape social hierarchies.  
- **Impact of Inequities**:  
  - **Disadvantaged groups** face **further health disadvantages**, reducing their **opportunities to be healthy**.  
- **Key Principle**: Health equity ensures **equal opportunity** to be healthy for all.  

### 🏥 Equity in Healthcare: Hypothetical Scenario  
- **Scenario**: A hypothetical country where:  
  - **Children from impoverished households** have:  
    - **Higher prevalence of stunting**.  
    - **Higher incidence of infectious diseases**.  
  - **Equal Clinic Visits**: The annual number of **clinic visits per child** is the same regardless of whether the child is from a poor or rich household.  
- **Analysis**:  
  - **Inequality in Health**: Higher stunting and disease rates among poor children.  
  - **Equality in Healthcare Utilization**: Equal clinic visits across income groups.  
- **Question**: Is this situation **fair or unfair**?  
  - **Opinion**: **Unfair**, as equal clinic visits do not address **underlying social determinants** (e.g., nutrition, sanitation) causing health disparities.  
  - **Role for Government Action**: Interventions to improve **living conditions** (e.g., clean water, food security) are needed to achieve equity.  
- **Key Insight**: *Equal provision of healthcare services does not guarantee equitable health outcomes.*

## ⚖️ 5. Resource Allocation and Equity  

### 📖 Allocation of Limited Resources  
- **Hypothetical Scenario in Malaysia**:  
  - An administrator of a rural district receives **RM 50,000** to start a project to improve health. The final list of projects includes:  
    1. **Installation of gravity-feed water system** to provide clean water to 2 remote **Orang Asli** villages (total population: 12 persons).  
    2. **Upgrade dental equipment** to improve preventive dental health services in all schools (benefits 1,200 school children).  
    3. **Family planning services for unmarried young people** to address increased cases of abandoned babies.  
- **Task**: As a member of the **district advisory committee**, choose one project to support and justify the choice.  
- **Evaluation of Projects**:  
  - **1. Gravity-Feed Water System**:  
    - **Arguments in Support**:  
      - **Low baseline health status** of Orang Asli communities indicates **higher needs**.  
      - Clean water addresses **fundamental social determinants**, reducing infectious diseases.  
    - **Arguments Against**:  
      - **Small population (12 persons)** limits overall impact compared to other projects.  
  - **2. School Oral Health Programme**:  
    - **Arguments in Support**:  
      - **Large numbers (1,200 children)** will benefit, maximizing reach.  
    - **Arguments Against**:  
      - **Oral health** in the district is at an **acceptable level**, so the programme may not significantly improve outcomes.  
  - **3. Family Planning Services**:  
    - **Arguments in Support**:  
      - **Reduces abandoned babies**, addressing a pressing social and health issue.  
      - Promotes **reproductive health** and empowerment for young people.  
    - **Arguments Against**:  
      - Potential **cultural resistance**, as services for unmarried youth may be seen as promoting promiscuity.  
- **Considerations**:  
  - **Equity**: Prioritize groups with **greatest need** (e.g., Orang Asli for water, vulnerable youth for family planning).  
  - **Impact**: Balance **number of beneficiaries** with **depth of need** (e.g., clean water for 12 vs. dental care for 1,200).  
  - **Feasibility**: Assess **cultural acceptance** and **implementation challenges** (e.g., family planning stigma).  
- **Not Just a Numbers Game**: Ethical considerations outweigh purely numerical benefits, emphasizing **equity** over **quantity**.

## 🧠 6. Ethical Theories in Health Policy  

### 📖 Ethical Dilemma in Health Policies  
- **Summary**:  
  - **Equality in health** is **not possible** due to **biological/genetic causes** that are generally not amenable to interventions.  
  - **Equality in healthcare receipt** may not be the **optimal goal** if it fails to address inequities.  
- **Policy Objectives**:  
  - **Remedy situations** deemed **unfair**, **unjust**, or **inequitable**.  
  - **Determine inequity** through **value judgments**.  
- **Value Judgments in Policies**:  
  - **Resource Allocation**: Who should benefit from limited resources?  
  - **Ethical Basis**: Often **ambiguous** or not **explicitly acknowledged**.  
  - **Implications**: Different ethical positions lead to **different notions of fairness**.  

### 🎯 Questions to Ponder  
- **What are the main ethical positions** that guide the allocation of scarce healthcare resources?  
- **Which position is dominant** in your country?  

### 🟢 Utilitarianism  
- **Source**: Roberts, M.J., et al. (2004). *Getting Health Reform Right*.  
- **Main Arguments**:  
  1. *What matters are the consequences of health policies on the well-being of individuals.*  
     - The **endpoint (well-being)** is prioritized over the **process** (“the ends justify the means”).  
  2. *The best policy is decided by adding up the gains and losses to all individuals.*  
     - Choose the policy that produces the **greatest good for the greatest number**.  
  3. *Concerned with aggregate welfare, not distribution.*  
     - All individuals are **treated equally**, regardless of disparities.  
- **In Health Policy**:  
  - **Principle**: *Greatest good for the greatest number.*  
  - **Implications**:  
    - May **disregard negative impacts** on minorities if the **total societal benefit** is maximized.  
    - **Equal consideration** can justify **ignoring minority needs** in favor of majority benefits.  
    - Supports policies to **reduce health disparities** only if they **maximize societal welfare**.  
  - **Critique**: May **neglect minority** or vulnerable groups, prioritizing aggregate outcomes over equity.  

### 🔵 Liberalism  
- **Source**: Roberts, M.J., et al. (2004). *Getting Health Reform Right*.  
- **Main Arguments**:  
  1. *Humans have the capacity to develop and implement their own decisions about how to live (life plans) and have a right to do so.*  
  2. *The role of the government is to ensure they are free to exercise these rights and to protect these rights.*  
- **Two Schools**:  
  - **Libertarianism**:  
    - **Focus**: **Negative rights** (freedom from interference, e.g., individual freedom, political, and civil rights).  
    - **Belief**: Advocates for **minimal government intervention**, mainly to protect **property rights** and **personal freedom**.  
  - **Egalitarianism**:  
    - **Focus**: **Positive rights** (entitlements to resources, e.g., right to healthcare).  
    - **Belief**: The **right to choose** is meaningless without **adequate resources**; government should provide a **minimum level of resources** (including healthcare) to ensure **fair equality of opportunities**.  
- **In Health Policy**:  
  - **Egalitarian Liberalism**:  
    - Most frequent position behind policies to **reduce health disparities**.  
    - **Food**, **housing**, and **healthcare** are **preconditions** for meaningful life choices.  
    - A **just society** should equalize these preconditions, using **taxation** for **public financing** of health services.  
  - **Implication**: Supports **publicly funded care** to ensure **equal access** to essential services.  

### 🟣 Communitarianism  
- **Source**: Roberts, M.J., et al. (2004). *Getting Health Reform Right*.  
- **Main Arguments**:  
  1. *Society is made up of communities of individuals.*  
  2. *Collective values of the community should shape health policies.*  
- **In Health Policy**:  
  - **Community Values**: Policies reflect norms, such as:  
    - **Acceptance/rejection of family planning methods**.  
    - **Acceptance/rejection of practices** like female genital mutilation.  
    - **Role of decision-makers** for healthcare in households.  
  - **Support for Equity**: Policies to reduce health disparities are supported if the community **values equity**.  
  - **Risk**: **Lack of tolerance for minority views** can be justified if they diverge from dominant community norms.  
  - **Critique**: May **suppress minority needs** if community norms prioritize majority values.

## 👥 7. Individual vs. Population Health  

### 🎯 Main Question  
- *Can classical epidemiological methodologies used to examine determinants of diseases in individuals be applied to studies of health inequities?*  

### 📖 Contrasting Approaches  
- **Traditional Clinical (Individual) Approach**:  
  - **Focus**: Individual patient.  
  - **Question**: *Why did THIS patient get this disease?*  
  - **Methods**: Uses **case-control** and **cohort study designs**.  
  - **Requirement**: Needs **heterogeneity of risk factors** among individuals.  
  - **Limitation**: Cannot explain differences in disease incidence in **homogeneous populations**.  
     - **Example**: Would **smoking** be identified as a risk factor for **lung cancer** in a population where **everyone smokes**?  
  - **Source**: Rose, G. (1985). *Sick individuals and sick populations*. *International Journal of Epidemiology*, 14, 32–38.  
- **Population Approach**:  
  - **Focus**: Entire populations.  
  - **Questions**:  
    - *Why do some populations have higher rates of a disease while others have lower rates?*  
    - **Example**: Why do some populations have **higher hypertension rates** while others have rare cases?  
  - **Key Insight**: *The determinants of incidence in a population are not necessarily the same as the causes of a disease in an individual.*  
  - **Implication**: Population strategies often **shift the entire distribution** of disease risk, addressing systemic inequities.

## 🩺 2. Policy Discussion: Separation of Drug Prescribing and Dispensing in Malaysia  

### 📋 Context: Private GP Practice  
- **Task**: *Discuss the merits of a policy on the separation of drug prescribing and dispensing in the context of private GP practice in Malaysia.*  
- **Current Practice**:  
  - In Malaysia, private **General Practitioners (GPs)** typically **prescribe and dispense** medications, integrating both roles in their clinics for convenience and revenue.  
- **Proposed Policy**:  
  - **Separation** mandates that GPs **prescribe** medications, while **pharmacists** handle **dispensing**, aligning with practices in countries like the UK and Australia.  

### 🌟 Merits of Separation  
- **Reduced Provider-Induced Demand**:  
  - GPs may **over-prescribe** or favor costly drugs to increase revenue, as dispensing is a **profit center**. Separation eliminates this **financial incentive**, ensuring prescriptions align with **clinical need**.  
- **Enhanced Patient Safety**:  
  - **Pharmacists**, as **medication experts**, can **verify prescriptions**, reducing risks of **medication errors**, **drug interactions**, or **inappropriate dosages**.  
- **Increased Transparency**:  
  - Patients receive **clear information** from pharmacists about medications, improving **informed decision-making**, **adherence**, and **health literacy**.  
- **Cost Control**:  
  - Pharmacists may offer **generic drugs** or **competitive pricing**, potentially lowering costs compared to GP-dispensed medications.  
- **Professional Specialization**:  
  - GPs focus on **diagnosis** and **treatment planning**, while pharmacists specialize in **medication management**, enhancing **care quality** and **efficiency**.  

### ⚠️ Challenges  
- **Access Issues**:  
  - In **rural Malaysia**, pharmacies are scarce, potentially inconveniencing patients who rely on GPs for one-stop services.  
- **Economic Impact on GPs**:  
  - Loss of dispensing revenue could threaten the **financial viability** of private GP practices, particularly small clinics.  
- **Implementation Costs**:  
  - Requires **regulatory frameworks**, **training**, and **pharmacy infrastructure** to support widespread dispensing.  
- **Patient Behavior**:  
  - Patients accustomed to GP convenience may resist visiting pharmacies separately, requiring **public education**.  

### 📌 Policy Recommendations  
- **Phased Implementation**: Start with **urban areas** where pharmacy networks are robust, piloting the policy before nationwide rollout.  
- **Support Mechanisms**: Provide **subsidies** or **transition incentives** for GPs and pharmacies to offset revenue losses and infrastructure costs.  
- **Public Awareness**: Launch **campaigns** to educate patients on the benefits of separation (e.g., safety, cost savings).  
- **Rural Considerations**: Develop **mobile pharmacies** or **telepharmacy** solutions to address access gaps in rural areas.

## 📈 3. Market Dynamics and Government Intervention  

### 🍋 Case Example: Lemonade Market  
- **Market Equilibrium**:  
  - Occurs when **quantity supplied equals quantity demanded** at a given price, achieving **market balance**.  
  - **Graph**: ![[Pasted image 20250518175830.png]]

        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - **Equilibrium Point**: At approximately **RM 1.50** and **80 cups**, where supply and demand intersect.  

- **Subsidy to Lemonade Producers**:  
  - A **subsidy** reduces **production costs**, shifting the **supply curve rightward**.  
  - **Impact**:  
    - **Lower price** (e.g., from RM 1.50 to RM 1.00).  
    - **Increased quantity** (e.g., from 80 to 100 cups).

        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - **Health Relevance**: Subsidies for healthcare (e.g., public clinics, vaccinations) **lower costs** and **increase access**, addressing **market failures**.  

- **Price Floor for Lemonade**:  
  - **Definition**: A **minimum price** set by the government (e.g., RM 1.50 or RM 2.50).  
  - **At RM 1.50**:  
    - **Equilibrium price**: No surplus or shortage, as it aligns with market equilibrium.  
  - **At RM 2.50**:  
    - **Excess supply** (surplus): Suppliers offer **400 cups**, but demand is only **100 cups**, leading to unsold stock.  
  - **Health Example**: Minimum pricing for drugs ensures **provider revenue** but may create **oversupply** or **reduced access** if patients cannot afford higher prices.  

- **Price Ceiling for Lemonade**:  
  - **Definition**: A **maximum price** set by the government (e.g., RM 2.50 or RM 1.50).  
  - **At RM 2.50**:  
    - **Above equilibrium**: No shortage, as suppliers meet demand at **100 cups**.  
  - **At RM 1.50**:  
    - **Below equilibrium**: **Excess demand** (shortage), with demand at **400 cups** but supply at **200 cups**, leading to unmet needs.  
  - **Health Example**: Price ceilings on essential drugs (e.g., generics) ensure **affordability** but risk **shortages** if suppliers reduce production due to low margins.  

### 📊 Features of Perfect Competition  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - **Many small firms and customers**: No single entity controls the market.  
  - **Identical products**: Consumers are indifferent to providers.  
  - **Freedom of entry and exit**: No barriers to market participation.  
  - **Perfect information**: All parties have full knowledge of prices, quality, and options.  
- **Health Market Deviation**:  
  - Healthcare markets deviate significantly from perfect competition, necessitating **government intervention** to correct inefficiencies.

## 🏛️ 4. Rationale for Government Intervention  

### 📖 Why Governments Intervene  
- **Present in Most Countries**:  
  - **Scope and extent** vary by national context (e.g., UK’s centralized NHS vs. USA’s decentralized market-based system; Malaysia’s dual public-private system vs. Singapore’s mixed financing).  
- **Productivity Link**:  
  - **Improved health status** enhances **economic productivity**, contributing to national development.  
  - **Causality Debate**: Does health drive productivity, or does economic growth enable better health?  
    - *“Health improvement is a development outcome, not just a consequence.”* — Deaton, A. (2003). *Journal of Economic Literature*, 41, 113–158.  
- **Market Failure**:  
  - The **healthcare market** cannot reliably provide **needed care**, **quality**, or **efficiency** due to structural issues.  
- **Equity**:  
  - Governments ensure **fair distribution** of healthcare and health outcomes, addressing disparities across **socioeconomic**, **geographic**, or **vulnerable groups**.  

### 🌐 Malaysia Context  
- **GDP per Capita (PPP)**: $9,421.  
- **Life Expectancy at Birth**: 72 years.  
- **Implication**: Malaysia’s dual healthcare system (public and private) reflects government efforts to balance **equity** (public subsidies) and **market efficiency** (private sector growth).  

### ⚖️ Equality vs. Equity  
- **Equality**:  
  - *Equal treatment for every person, regardless of need.*  
  - May not be ideal in health, as needs vary (e.g., sicker patients require more care).  
- **Equity**:  
  - *Involves moral and ethical dimensions, representing equality with fairness and distributive justice.*  
    - **Source**: Mulholland, E. K., et al. (2008).  
  - *Refers to differences in health that are unnecessary, avoidable, unjust, and unfair.*  
    - **Source**: Whitehead, M. (1990).  
  - *The absence of systematic disparities in health (or its social determinants) between social groups with different levels of social advantage/disadvantage.*  
    - **Source**: Braveman, P., Gruskin, S. (2006).  
- **Government Role**: Promote **equity** by ensuring **access to care** as a **fundamental right**, particularly for the **poor** and **vulnerable**, countering **free market inefficiencies**.  

---

## 📉 5. Market Failures in Health  

### 📋 What is Market Failure?  
- **Definition**: *Situations where the market fails to allocate resources efficiently, leading to suboptimal healthcare outcomes.*  
- **Health-Specific Failures**:  
  - **Public and Merit Goods**: Under-provided by markets.  
  - **Externalities**: Benefits or costs affecting third parties.  
  - **Insurance Market**: Issues like **adverse selection** and **moral hazard**.  

### 🔍 Deviations from Perfect Competition  
- **Provider Consolidation**:  
  - **Evolution**: From **single/small entities** to **large, organized structures** (e.g., hospital chains, pharmaceutical conglomerates).  
  - **Reason**: **Economies of scale** reduce **unit costs** (average costs decrease as production scales).  
  - **Impact**: Creates **monopolies** or **oligopolies**, reducing competition and increasing costs.  
  - **Malaysia Example**:  
    - **Single Practitioner Clinics**: Traditional small-scale GP practices.  
    - **Group Practices (Panel Doctors)**: Collaborative models under insurance or corporate schemes.  
    - **Managed Care Organizations (MCOs)**: Large-scale providers integrating services for efficiency.  
- **Product Differentiation**:  
  - Healthcare is **not homogeneous**; private providers compete on **perceived quality** rather than just price.  
  - **Examples**:  
    - Adoption of **high-tech medicine** (e.g., advanced diagnostics).  
    - New **treatment modalities** (e.g., minimally invasive surgeries).  
    - Recruitment of **senior, well-known doctors** to attract patients.  
- **Entry Restrictions**:  
  - **Training Limits**: Restricted admissions to **medical schools** and **recognition** of institutions.  
  - **Licensure**: Providers must meet **regulatory requirements** (e.g., pre-Brexit restrictions on non-EU doctors in the UK).  
  - **Malaysia Example**: Limited medical school seats and strict licensing by the Malaysian Medical Council.  
- **Ethical Constraints**:  
  - **Code of Practice**: Prohibits **advertising** or **competing with colleagues** in some countries, limiting market dynamics.  
  - **Malaysia Example**: Malaysian Medical Association guidelines restrict overt advertising by doctors.  
- **Intellectual Property Rights and Patents**:  
  - **Patents**: Grant **exclusive rights** for pharmaceuticals and medical devices for a limited time, preventing others from producing or selling the product.  
  - **Impact**: Reduces **competition**, restricts production to patent holders, and increases **costs**.  
  - **Example**: High-cost patented drugs limit access in Malaysia’s private sector.  
- **Asymmetry of Information**:  
  - Patients lack **perfect information** due to the **technical nature** of medical knowledge, requiring training to understand.  
  - **Provider Behavior**:  
    - Doctors may **withhold information** to avoid distressing patients (e.g., fearing patients cannot handle “bad” diagnoses).  
    - Even when **full information** is provided, patients may not comprehend enough to make **informed decisions**.  
  - **Malaysia Example**: Patients often rely on GP expertise, exacerbating information gaps.  
- **Provider-Induced Demand**:  
  - Providers may **over-provide services** (e.g., unnecessary tests, procedures) to increase income, especially under **fee-for-service** models.  
  - Driven by **financial incentives** or **investments** in healthcare facilities (e.g., diagnostic equipment).  
  - **Malaysia Example**: GPs dispensing medications may prescribe more to boost revenue, a key issue in the separation policy debate.  

### 🛡️ Public and Merit Goods  
- **Public Goods**:  
  - *Economic goods that are non-rivalrous (consumption by one does not reduce availability) and non-excludable (cannot prevent access once provided).*  
  - **Examples**:  
    - **Health information** (e.g., public health campaigns on dengue prevention).  
    - **Clean air** and **non-polluted rivers** (environmental health).  
    - **Lighthouses** (analogous to universal benefits).  
- **Public Goods in Health**:  
  - **Information on health** (e.g., Malaysia’s MySejahtera app for COVID-19 updates).  
  - **Environmental measures** (e.g., clean water initiatives).  
- **Merit Goods**:  
  - *Goods under-consumed in markets because users prioritize personal utility, ignoring positive externalities or long-term benefits.*  
  - **Examples**:  
    - **Vaccines** (e.g., Malaysia’s National Immunization Programme).  
    - **Vector control** (e.g., fogging for dengue).  
    - **Screening programs** (e.g., breast cancer screenings).  

### 🌐 Externalities in Health  
- **Definition**: *Costs or benefits from a decision that affect individuals or groups other than the decision-maker.*  
- **Types**:  
  - **Negative Externality**:  
    - Causes **harm** to others (e.g., **secondhand smoke**, **pollution**).  
    - **Example**: Smoking in public spaces in Malaysia, addressed by **smoking bans**.  
  - **Positive Externality**:  
    - **Benefits** others (e.g., **immunization** conferring **herd immunity**).  
    - **Example**: Malaysia’s high vaccination rates for childhood diseases protect communities.  
- **Health Example**:  
  - **Preventive measures** like **mass immunization** protect unvaccinated individuals, justifying government funding.  

### 🛡️ Insurance Market Failures  
- **Causes**:  
  - **Information Asymmetry**:  
    - **Adverse Selection**: High-risk individuals are more likely to buy insurance, increasing **premiums**.  
    - **Impact**: Excludes the **poor** and drives **healthy individuals** out of the market.  
    - **Example**: Malaysia’s private insurance market sees limited uptake among low-income groups.  
  - **Moral Hazard**:  
    - Insured individuals **overuse services** (e.g., unnecessary consultations) due to reduced **perceived costs**.  
    - **Example**: Overuse of private clinic visits under corporate insurance plans in Malaysia.  
- **Consequences**:  
  - **Unaffordable insurance** for low-income groups.  
  - **Cost escalation** due to increased utilization.  
  - **Market Failure**: Insurance markets may not develop adequately without intervention.  
- **Government Response**:  
  - Develop **Social Health Insurance (SHI)** to ensure **broad coverage** and mitigate market failures.  
  - **Malaysia Example**: Proposals for a national SHI to complement the public system.  

### 🔧 Correction of Market Failures  
- **Market Shortcomings**:  
  - Individuals **under-utilize** public/merit goods with **positive externalities** or **long-term benefits** (e.g., skipping screenings).  
  - Many remain **uninsured** due to high premiums.  
  - **Negative externalities** (e.g., smoking) persist without intervention.  
- **Government Tools**:  
  - **Subsidies**: Fund public/merit goods (e.g., Malaysia’s free vaccinations).  
  - **Direct Provision**: Operate public hospitals and clinics.  
  - **Financing**: Support insurance for the poor (e.g., Malaysia’s public healthcare subsidies).  
  - **Pigouvian Taxes**: Target **negative externalities** (e.g., **carbon taxes**).  
  - **Sin Taxes**: Discourage harmful consumption (e.g., Malaysia’s **tobacco** and **alcohol** taxes).
