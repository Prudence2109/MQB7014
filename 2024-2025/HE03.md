- **Lecture Recap**: Synthesizes key takeaways, emphasizing the interplay of demand, payment, and insurance in healthcare systems ✅.

### 🔑 Key Themes and Findings

The lecture highlights several critical insights that underpin health economics and inform public health policy:

- **Health as a Capital Good**: **Health** is a **durable capital stock** that produces **healthy time**, as per Grossman’s theory. **Demand for healthcare** is derived from the **demand for health**, which stems from the **demand for utility** 💡. This framework underscores why individuals invest in healthcare to enhance well-being.
- **Production of Health**: Historically, **rising standards of living** (e.g., improved nutrition) were the primary drivers of mortality decline, with **medical technology** playing a minimal role, as per **McKeown’s Thesis**. Modern evidence shows **adequate healthcare access** extends life expectancy (e.g., 2.0–2.5 years at age 65 in China) 🌿.
- **Rational Decision-Making Challenges**: Consumers weigh **costs** vs. **benefits**, but **healthcare’s technical nature** and **asymmetric information** complicate choices, often leading to reliance on providers 🧠.
- **Malaysian Context**: Studies (e.g., Heller 1975, Rozita et al. 1996) reveal that **income** drives shifts to **private care**, **age** creates a **U-shaped demand pattern**, and **subsidized public care** ensures access. The **public sector** handles chronic conditions, while **private clinics** focus on acute care 🇲🇾.
- **Payment Mechanisms**: Methods like **fee-for-service** encourage comprehensive care but risk **provider-induced demand**, while **capitation** and **global budgets** promote cost control but may reduce quality or access 💳.
- **Insurance and Moral Hazard**: **Insurance** lowers financial barriers, increasing demand, especially for **elastic demand** services (e.g., GP visits for fever, shifting from $Q_1$ at $P_1$ to $Q_2$ at price 0). **Moral hazard**—overuse due to reduced risk—is mitigated by **copayments**, **coinsurance**, and **deductibles** ⚠️.

### 📊 Policy Implications

The lecture’s findings have significant implications for healthcare policy:

- **Enhance Health Investments**: Promote **preventive care** and education to bolster **health capital**, aligning with Grossman’s model.
- **Address Market Inefficiencies**: Regulate **provider influence** and ensure **equity** to counter **asymmetric information** and **externalities** in healthcare.
- **Tailor Malaysian Policies**: Leverage insights from **Malaysian studies** to address **income disparities** and **ethnic preferences**, strengthening the **public-private healthcare system**.
- **Optimize Payment Systems**: Balance **payment mechanisms** to control costs while maintaining care quality, avoiding pitfalls like **provider-induced demand** or **adverse selection**.
- **Mitigate Moral Hazard**: Implement **cost-sharing mechanisms** to curb overuse without compromising access to essential care.

## 📚 1. Introduction and Learning Outcomes

**Health Economics** is a dynamic field that dives into how individuals and societies prioritize and access **health** and **healthcare**, shaped by core economic principles like **supply**, **demand**, and **market structures**. This lecture, **HE 3 - Demand for Health and Health Care**, serves as a cornerstone for understanding these concepts, exploring the **production of health**, the **theoretical and empirical dimensions of demand**, and the pivotal roles of **payment mechanisms** and **insurance** in healthcare systems. It emphasizes how these elements influence the behaviors of both **providers** (e.g., doctors, hospitals) and **patients**, offering insights into the complex interplay of economics and health.

### 🔍 Revision of Foundational Concepts

To set the stage, let’s revisit the bedrock economic principles that underpin health economics. These concepts provide the framework for analyzing how health and healthcare are demanded and supplied in markets.

- **Law of Demand**: *When the price falls, the quantity demanded rises.* 📉 This means that as healthcare services become more affordable, people tend to seek them out more frequently, whether for check-ups, treatments, or preventive care.
- **Law of Supply**: *When the price increases, the quantity supplied rises.* 📈 Higher payments or reimbursements incentivize providers (e.g., hospitals, clinics) to offer more services, such as additional appointments or specialized treatments.
- **Perfectly Competitive Market**: *Equilibrium occurs when the quantity of goods supplied equals the quantity demanded.* ⚖️ In an ideal market, the amount of healthcare services provided matches what patients seek, balancing costs and access at an equilibrium price.

These principles guide our understanding of healthcare markets, though real-world complexities—like information asymmetries and externalities—often deviate from perfect competition, as we’ll explore later.

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this unit, students will be equipped with a robust understanding of key health economics concepts and their practical implications. The learning outcomes are designed to build both theoretical knowledge and analytical skills, enabling you to navigate the intricacies of healthcare systems. Specifically, you will be able to:

- **Understand** the distinction between **demand for health** and **demand for healthcare** 🏥. Health is a broader concept, akin to a capital stock that produces well-being, while healthcare is a tool to achieve or maintain it. Grasping this difference is crucial for analyzing health-seeking behaviors.
- **Explain** the impact of **provider payment mechanisms** on provider behavior 💰. Whether providers are paid per service, per patient, or through fixed budgets shapes their incentives, affecting the **quantity**, **quality**, and **cost** of care delivered.
- **Comprehend** the concept of **insurance** and its role in healthcare systems 🛡️. Insurance reduces financial barriers to care but introduces challenges like increased demand, which we’ll explore through the lens of moral hazard.
- **Discuss** **moral hazard** and its relation to third-party payers 🤔. When insurers or governments cover costs, patients and providers may behave differently, potentially overusing services—a phenomenon known as moral hazard.
- **Describe** strategies to **influence demand for healthcare** 📊. From adjusting provider payments to implementing patient cost-sharing, various tools can shape how much healthcare is sought and delivered.

## 🩺 3. Production of Health

The **Production of Health** is a foundational concept in health economics, exploring how various inputs—such as healthcare, nutrition, and public health measures—are transformed into health outcomes. This section lies at the **heart of health economics and public policy**, offering critical insights into how societies can efficiently allocate **scarce resources** to improve population health. By examining historical and modern evidence, including **McKeown’s Thesis** and recent studies, this section addresses the factors driving health production, the role of healthcare, and how these dynamics have evolved over time.

### 📖 Why Study Health Production?

**Definition**: *Health production involves transforming inputs (e.g., healthcare, nutrition) into outputs (e.g., improved health status).* 🛠️ This process is akin to a factory where raw materials (inputs) are converted into valuable products (health outcomes), but in this case, the goal is enhancing well-being and longevity.

**Significance**:
- Lies at the **heart of health economics and public policy**. Understanding health production is essential for designing policies that maximize health gains within constrained budgets.
- Guides **efficient allocation** of **scarce resources**. With limited funds, policymakers must prioritize investments—whether in hospitals, sanitation, or education—that yield the greatest health benefits.
- Informs selection of **optimal production pathways**. By identifying the most effective inputs, societies can choose strategies that balance cost, access, and impact.

**Key Questions**:
1. What factors influence the **production of health**? Are medical interventions, lifestyle choices, or environmental factors most critical?
2. What is the **contribution of healthcare** to health production? How much does access to doctors and hospitals matter compared to other inputs?
3. Has this contribution **changed over time**? Have advancements in medical technology shifted the balance of what drives health improvements?

These questions frame the exploration of health production, setting the stage for a deeper dive into historical and contemporary evidence.

### 📚 McKeown’s Thesis

**Context**: Thomas McKeown analyzed the **dramatic population growth** in England and Wales from around 1770 to the 20th century. His work, detailed in *The Modern Rise of Population* (McKeown, T., 1967, New York: Academic Press), challenged conventional assumptions about the drivers of health improvements during this period. 📘

**Key Findings**:
- **Population Growth**: Primarily due to a **decline in mortality** rather than in-migration or increased fertility rates 🚼. People were living longer, not just having more children or moving to the region.
- **Mortality Decline**: Most prominent for **infectious diseases**, especially **airborne infections** (e.g., tuberculosis, bronchitis, pneumonia, influenza) 😷. These diseases, once major killers, saw significant reductions in death rates.
- **Timeline**:
  - 1838–1970: Decline in **tuberculosis (TB) mortality** in England and Wales, observed through historical records.
  - 1882: Koch identifies the **TB bacillus**, marking a scientific breakthrough in understanding the disease.
  - 1940s: Introduction of **streptomycin**, an antibiotic that revolutionized TB treatment.
  - 1953: **BCG immunization** for all children, providing widespread protection against TB.
- **Conclusions**:
  - **Medical Technology**: Played a **minimal role** in mortality decline 🩺. McKeown noted that TB mortality was already falling significantly before the introduction of streptomycin or BCG, suggesting other factors were at play.
  - **Public Health Measures**: Important but not the major contributor (e.g., immunizations, clean water supplies, sewage systems) 💉. While these interventions helped, they were secondary to broader societal changes.
  - **Rising Standards of Living**: The **most important factor**, enhancing **nutritional status** that led to increased **disease resistance** 🍽️. Better food access and quality strengthened immune systems, reducing susceptibility to infections.

#### Table: McKeown’s Thesis Summary

| **Insight**                   | **Finding**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cause of Population Growth** | Decline in mortality, not increased births or migration                     |
| **Cause of Mortality Decline** | Reduced airborne infectious diseases (e.g., TB, pneumonia)                 |
| **Role of Medical Technology** | Minimal                                                                    |
| **Role of Public Health**     | Important but not the primary contributor                                  |
| **Key Driver**                | Improved living standards, especially nutrition, enhancing disease resistance |

McKeown’s findings highlight that health improvements often stem from socioeconomic advancements rather than medical breakthroughs alone, a perspective that remains relevant for modern health policy.

### 📈 Contribution of Healthcare to Health

This subsection evaluates the role of **healthcare** in producing health, distinguishing between its **total contribution** over history and its **marginal contribution** in specific contexts. It also connects healthcare access to the broader **demand for healthcare**.

- **Total Contribution**:
  - History shows that over long periods, **curative medical care** may not have been the most significant factor in health improvements. As McKeown’s Thesis suggests, factors like nutrition and sanitation drove early mortality declines, with medical interventions playing a supporting role.

- **Marginal Contribution**:
  - Recent evidence highlights that **adequate access to healthcare** significantly extends life expectancy, particularly in older populations. Modern healthcare systems, with advanced diagnostics and treatments, have a measurable impact on health outcomes.
  - **Example (China Study)**:
    - At age 65: **Adequate access to healthcare** increased life expectancy by approximately **2.0–2.5 years** in men and women, across urban-rural areas, compared to those with inadequate access 🧓. This demonstrates healthcare’s value in extending productive years.
    - At age 85: The corresponding increase was **1.0–1.2 years**. Even in advanced age, healthcare access makes a difference, though the effect diminishes.
    - **Source**: Hao, L., et al. (2020). *Adequate access to healthcare and added life expectancy among older adults in China*. *BMC Geriatrics*, 20(1), 129. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-01524-9.

- **Conclusion**: The **relationship between consumption of healthcare and improved health** leads to the **demand for healthcare** 🔄. When people see tangible health benefits—such as longer life or better quality of life—they are more likely to seek healthcare services, driving demand in healthcare systems.

#### Table: Healthcare’s Contribution to Health

| **Aspect**                  | **Insight**                                                                                       | **Example**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Total Contribution**      | Curative care less significant than living standards historically                                 | McKeown’s Thesis: Nutrition > medical care in 19th-century mortality decline |
| **Marginal Contribution**   | Modern healthcare extends life expectancy, especially in older populations                        | China Study: +2.0–2.5 years at age 65, +1.0–1.2 years at age 85            |
| **Link to Demand**          | Health improvements from healthcare consumption drive demand for services                        | Patients seek care when it demonstrably enhances health                      |

This analysis underscores that while healthcare is not the sole driver of health, its targeted contributions—especially in aging populations—fuel the demand for medical services, a key focus of health economics.

## ❤️ 4. Demand for Health and Healthcare

The **Demand for Health and Healthcare** is a cornerstone of health economics, exploring why and how individuals seek health and the services that support it. This section delves into the **rational decision-making** processes that guide consumer choices, the **unique characteristics** of healthcare that complicate these decisions, and **Michael Grossman’s influential theory** of health as a capital stock. By blending theoretical frameworks with practical insights, this section illuminates the forces driving healthcare demand and sets the stage for understanding how it can be influenced through policy and payment mechanisms.

### ⚖️ Rational Decision-Making

**Rational decision-making** underpins economic models of consumer behavior, assuming individuals make calculated choices to maximize their well-being. In the context of health and healthcare, this process involves weighing costs against benefits to decide whether and how much to consume healthcare services.

- **Main Assumptions**:
  - Consumers have the **ability to judge** based on **information** about:
    - **Costs of consumption** (e.g., price, time, and other costs). These include out-of-pocket expenses, travel time to clinics, or missed work hours.
    - **Benefits of consumption** (e.g., health improvements). Benefits might include reduced pain, longer life expectancy, or improved quality of life.
  - **Costs and benefits** are borne by the consumer. In a typical market, individuals directly experience the financial and health outcomes of their choices.
  - Consumers make decisions to:
    - **Consume or not consume** a service. For example, deciding whether to visit a doctor for a minor ailment.
    - If consuming, decide **how much to consume**. This might involve choosing between a single consultation or ongoing treatment.

- **Decision Logic**:
  - **Axiom of Completeness**: Consumers can **order preferences** 🧾. They can rank options (e.g., seeing a doctor vs. self-medicating vs. doing nothing) based on perceived value.
  - **Axiom of Transitivity**: If bundle $A$ is preferred to $B$, and $B$ to $C$, then $A$ is preferred to $C$. This ensures consistent decision-making across choices.
  - **Axiom of Selection**: Consumers choose the **most preferred state**. They select the option that maximizes their utility, or overall satisfaction.

- **Expected Utility Theory**:
  - Consumers can judge **costs and benefits** under **conditions of uncertainty** using the concept of **risk**. For instance, they assess the likelihood that a treatment will improve their health versus potential side effects.
  - Only **consequences (outcomes)** matter, not the process of decision-making. The focus is on the end result (e.g., better health) rather than how the decision was reached.
  - Assumes **separation of consumption and production**. In traditional markets, consumers buy goods produced by others, distinct from their own production activities.

This framework assumes consumers are well-informed and autonomous, but as we’ll see, healthcare’s unique nature challenges these assumptions.

### 🚨 Special Nature of Healthcare

Healthcare deviates from standard consumer goods due to its **complexity** and **societal impacts**, complicating rational decision-making. The **unique characteristics** of healthcare create a distinct market where consumers, providers, and society interact in nuanced ways.

- **Unique Characteristics**:
  - **Health information is highly technical**, making it difficult for consumers to judge **costs and benefits**. Unlike buying a car or groceries, assessing the necessity or efficacy of a medical procedure requires specialized knowledge.
  - Consumers may **relinquish decisions** to **healthcare professionals**. Patients often defer to doctors’ expertise, trusting them to recommend treatments.
  - **Healthcare professionals (suppliers)** can **directly or indirectly influence** the consumption (demand) of healthcare. For example, a doctor might suggest additional tests or procedures, shaping patient choices.
  - **Supplier and consumer roles** cannot be fully separated. Unlike traditional markets, healthcare providers both supply services and guide consumption, creating potential conflicts of interest.

- **Externalities in Health**:
  - **Costs and benefits** are not only borne by the consumer but also affect **society**. For instance, vaccinating one person reduces disease spread, benefiting the community (a positive externality).
  - **Resultant utility** extends beyond consumption of care to include:
    - **Fair distribution** (equity). Access to healthcare is often valued for its role in reducing health disparities.
    - **Passing on difficult decision-making** to professionals. Patients gain peace of mind by delegating complex choices to experts.

These characteristics highlight why healthcare markets require special consideration, as consumer autonomy is limited, and societal impacts are significant.

### 📜 Grossman’s Theory of Health Demand

**Source**: Grossman, M. (1972). *On the Concept of Health Capital and the Demand for Health*. *Journal of Political Economy*, 80, 223–255. 📘 This seminal work revolutionized health economics by introducing the concept of **health as a capital stock**, offering a robust framework for understanding demand.

- **Core Proposition**:
  - **Health** is a **durable capital stock** that produces an output of **healthy time** 👤. Health is like a long-lasting asset (e.g., a machine) that generates valuable time for work, leisure, or family.
  - Individuals inherit an **initial stock of health** that:
    - **Depreciates** with age (potentially at a non-constant rate). As people age, their health naturally declines due to biological wear and tear.
    - Can be **increased** by investment (e.g., healthcare, lifestyle choices). Regular check-ups, exercise, or healthy diets can bolster this stock.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Individuals act as both **consumers** and **producers** of health. They consume healthcare services but also actively invest resources to maintain or improve their health.
  - The **idea of the individual as a producer** concerns how they **allocate resources** (time and money) to produce health. For example, choosing to spend time exercising or money on medical care.
  - **Investing in human capital** (health and education) improves outcomes in:
    - **Market sectors** (e.g., work productivity). Healthier individuals can work longer and earn more.
    - **Non-market sectors** (e.g., household roles). Good health enhances family care or personal well-being.
  - **Shadow Price of Health**: Depends on variables beyond medical care costs, such as:
    - **Age**: Rises if the **depreciation rate** of health increases over the life cycle. Older individuals face higher costs to maintain health due to faster deterioration.
    - **Education**: Falls if more educated people are **more efficient producers** of health. Educated individuals may better understand health information or adopt healthier habits.
  - **Implication**: An increase in the shadow price may **simultaneously reduce the quantity of health demanded** and **increase the quantity of medical care demanded**. As maintaining health becomes costlier, people may accept lower health levels but seek more healthcare to slow depreciation.

#### Table: Grossman’s Theory at a Glance

| **Concept**                  | **Description**                                                                 | **Example**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Health as Capital Stock**  | Health is a durable asset producing **healthy time** 👤                        | Good health enables more work hours or leisure activities                   |
| **Depreciation & Investment**| Health declines with age but can be bolstered by investments (e.g., healthcare) | Regular check-ups or exercise slow health decline                           |
| **Consumer & Producer Role** | Individuals consume and produce health by allocating resources                 | Spending time on exercise or money on doctor visits                         |
| **Shadow Price**             | Cost of maintaining health, influenced by age and education                    | Older age increases costs; education lowers them through efficiency         |
| **Implication**              | Higher shadow price reduces health demanded, increases medical care demand     | Elderly may accept lower health but seek more treatments                    |

#### Key Principles of Demand

Grossman’s theory provides a foundation for understanding the **derived nature** of healthcare demand and the **active role** of individuals in health production.

- **Derived Demand**:
  - **Demand for healthcare** is derived from the **demand for health** 💡. People seek healthcare because it helps achieve or maintain good health.
  - **Demand for health** is derived from the **demand for utility**. Health contributes to overall well-being, enabling work, leisure, or social activities.

- **Active Role**:
  - Individuals are **not passive consumers** but **active producers** who spend **time and money** on the production of health. They make deliberate choices, like dieting or seeking medical care, to enhance their health stock.

- **Health as Capital**:
  - Health **lasts over time periods**, **depreciates**, and can be analyzed as a **capital good** 🔄. Like a car or house, health requires maintenance and investment to remain functional over time.

These principles underscore that healthcare demand is not an end in itself but a means to achieve health, which in turn supports broader life goals.

By examining these studies, we gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics shaping Malaysia’s dual **public-private healthcare system** and the factors driving demand across diverse populations. The section concludes with a detailed **summary table** comparing financing and utilization between public and private sectors, offering a snapshot of Malaysia’s healthcare landscape.

### 📖 Overview

**Empirical studies in Malaysia** provide critical insights into healthcare demand, highlighting the influence of **income**, **age**, **ethnicity**, and **accessibility** on health-seeking behavior. These studies draw on robust data sources, such as household surveys and national health morbidity surveys, to uncover how economic, demographic, and geographic factors shape the choices individuals make when seeking care. By analyzing these patterns, policymakers can design interventions to improve access, reduce inequities, and optimize resource allocation in Malaysia’s healthcare system.

### 🔍 Key Studies on Healthcare Demand

#### Peter Heller’s Classic Study (1975)

- **Source**: Heller, P. S. (1982). *A model of the demand for medical and health services in Peninsular Malaysia*. *Social Science & Medicine*, 16, 267–284. 📚
- **Data**: From a **1975 household survey** in Peninsular Malaysia, capturing a snapshot of health-seeking behavior during a period of economic growth and healthcare expansion.
- **Findings**:
  - **Demand for outpatient and inpatient care** is **highly inelastic** to **cash price**, **income**, or **time costs**. This means that changes in costs (e.g., consultation fees, travel time) had little impact on whether people sought care, suggesting strong underlying need or access to subsidies.
  - As **income increases**, households:
    - Shift demand from **traditional practitioners** to **modern medical practitioners**. Wealthier households preferred Western-trained doctors over traditional healers.
    - Shift demand from **public clinics** to **private clinics**. Private facilities, perceived as offering faster or higher-quality care, became more appealing.
    - Shift demand from **home deliveries** to **hospital deliveries**. Increased income enabled safer, facility-based childbirth.
    - Increase demand for **prenatal care** (preventive care). Higher-income households prioritized preventive measures, reflecting greater health awareness.
  - **Findings did not reveal a U-shaped relationship** between age and demand for outpatient care. Unlike some contexts where demand peaks among the young and elderly, this study found no such pattern.
  - **Findings partially attributable** to accessibility to **subsidized public care**. Malaysia’s public healthcare system, offering low-cost services, ensured broad access, reducing cost barriers.

#### Rozita et al.’s Study (1996)

- **Data**: From the 2nd **National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS)** conducted in 1996, a comprehensive dataset reflecting Malaysia’s diverse population and healthcare needs.
- **Findings**:
  - **Higher outpatient demand** among the **young** and **older persons**, showing a **U-shaped age demand pattern** 📊. Children and the elderly sought more frequent care, likely due to higher vulnerability to illness.
  - **No gender differences** in demand. Men and women accessed outpatient services at similar rates, indicating equitable utilization by gender.
  - **Distance** was **not a deterrent** to utilization of services. Even in geographically diverse Malaysia, proximity to facilities did not significantly limit care-seeking.
  - **Chinese** households were **more likely to choose private care**. Cultural or economic factors may have driven this preference for private clinics.
  - **Households with higher income** demonstrated a **preference for private healthcare**. Wealthier families opted for private facilities, likely valuing shorter wait times or perceived quality.

## ⚙️ 6. Influencing Demand for Healthcare

Understanding how to **influence demand for healthcare** is a critical aspect of health economics, as it allows policymakers and healthcare systems to balance access, quality, and cost. This section explores the mechanisms through which demand can be shaped, focusing on **supply-side measures** that affect providers and **demand-side measures** that influence patient behavior. Central to this discussion is the **role of payment mechanisms**, which can alter how healthcare services are delivered and consumed. By examining these strategies, this section provides insights into designing effective healthcare policies that align incentives with public health goals.

### 📋 Overview

**Demand for healthcare** can be influenced through two primary approaches:

- **Supply-Side Measures**: Factors related to **providers of care**, such as the **number and distribution of facilities** and **doctors** 🏥. These involve structural aspects of the healthcare system, like building more clinics in underserved areas or increasing the number of trained healthcare professionals to enhance service availability.
- **Demand-Side Measures**: Factors related to **individual choices**, such as **disposable income**, **education**, and **preferences** 🛍️. These focus on patient-level factors, such as how much money people have to spend on healthcare, their understanding of health needs, or their preference for certain types of care (e.g., private vs. public).

These approaches work together to shape how much healthcare is sought and provided, addressing issues like overuse, underuse, or inequities in access.

### 🩺 Role of Payment Mechanisms

**Key Idea**: *Demand for healthcare can be affected by the manner in which healthcare services are paid.* 💰 The way providers are compensated and patients are charged fundamentally influences the behavior of both groups, impacting the volume, type, and cost of healthcare services consumed.

- **Mechanisms**:
  - **Supply-Side Measures**: Changing **provider behavior** through different **payment mechanisms**. For example, paying doctors per service (fee-for-service) might encourage more procedures, while a fixed salary could promote efficiency but reduce productivity. These payment structures create incentives that shape how providers deliver care, affecting the availability and quality of services.
  - **Demand-Side Measures**: Changing **patient behavior** through the impact of **third-party payers** such as insurance companies. When insurance covers most or all costs, patients may seek more care than necessary, increasing demand. Conversely, requiring patients to pay a portion of costs (e.g., copayments) can moderate overuse.

#### Table: Approaches to Influencing Healthcare Demand

| **Approach**            | **Focus**                                                                 | **Examples**                                                                 | **Impact on Demand**                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Supply-Side Measures** | Factors related to **providers of care** 🏥                               | Number/distribution of facilities, doctor availability, payment mechanisms     | Alters service availability and provider incentives    |
| **Demand-Side Measures** | Factors related to **individual choices** 🛍️                              | Disposable income, education, preferences, third-party payer effects          | Influences patient care-seeking behavior and frequency |

This table highlights how supply-side and demand-side measures target different actors in the healthcare system—providers and patients—to shape overall demand. Payment mechanisms serve as a bridge, linking these approaches by aligning incentives for both groups.

### 🌟 Why Payment Mechanisms Matter

The **manner in which healthcare services are paid** is a powerful lever for influencing demand. On the supply side, payment mechanisms like capitation or global budgets can encourage providers to prioritize preventive care or cost containment. On the demand side, third-party payers, such as insurance companies, reduce financial barriers for patients, potentially increasing utilization but also raising concerns about overuse. Understanding these dynamics is essential for crafting policies that ensure equitable access to care while controlling costs and maintaining quality.

## 💰 7. Provider Payment Mechanisms

**Provider payment mechanisms** are pivotal tools in health economics, shaping how healthcare services are delivered and consumed. These mechanisms determine how **doctors** and **hospitals** are compensated, influencing the **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** provided. This section explores a range of payment methods, from **simple** per-procedure payments to **complex** annual budgets, detailing their definitions, examples, impacts, and incentives. By understanding these mechanisms, students can grasp how financial structures drive provider behavior, affect patient care, and impact healthcare system efficiency.

### 📖 Overview

**Provider payment mechanisms** vary by the **unit of payment**, ranging from **simple** (e.g., payment per procedure) to **complex/aggregated** (e.g., payment for a year’s services). These methods impact **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** for **doctors** and **hospitals**. Each mechanism creates unique incentives, balancing benefits like improved access with challenges like cost escalation or reduced care quality. This section examines six key mechanisms, highlighting their practical implications and theoretical underpinnings.

### 🔍 Key Payment Mechanisms

#### Fee-for-Service (FFS)

- **Definition**: *Provider receives a fee for every service given.* 🩺 This straightforward method compensates providers for each individual action, such as consultations or tests.
- **Example**: If a patient is seen by a GP, has a chest X-ray, and receives an injection, the GP receives a **consultation fee**, a **fee for the CXR**, and a **fee for the injection**. This granular payment structure rewards each service rendered.
- **Potential Impact**: Affects **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** for doctors and hospitals. FFS can drive up costs by encouraging more services but may ensure thorough care.
- **Incentives**:
  - **Beneficial**:
    - Patients are likely to receive **optimal level and quality of care**. Providers are motivated to offer comprehensive services, ensuring patient needs are met.
    - Patients requiring **complex treatment** are not likely to be denied care. FFS supports extensive interventions, as providers are paid for each step.
  - **Adverse**:
    - **Provider-Induced Demand (PID)**: Providers may over-provide services to increase income due to financial incentives 🤝. For example, ordering unnecessary tests boosts revenue.
- **Principal-Agent Relationship**:
  - **Principal**: Patient.
  - **Agent**: Provider.
  - **Principal-Agent Problem**: Due to **asymmetry of information**, the principal may not be able to ensure that the agent is acting in their **best interest**, especially if provision is linked to increased income. Patients, lacking medical expertise, may struggle to discern necessary from excessive care.

#### Per Diem Payment

- **Definition**: *Hospital receives one fixed payment that covers all services delivered to one patient for one day.* 🛏️ This method simplifies billing by providing a single daily rate, regardless of services provided.
- **Example**: Mr. ABC is admitted for pneumonia, and Mr. DEF is admitted for backache; both are discharged after one day. The hospital receives the **same payment** for both, regardless of the type and quantity of services received, such as medications or diagnostics.
- **Potential Impact**: Affects **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** for hospitals. Per diem payments aim for daily efficiency but can skew care delivery.
- **Incentives**:
  - **Providers have incentives to provide less in a day**, as payment is the same regardless of the quantity or quality of services provided. Hospitals may minimize daily interventions to save costs.
  - **May prolong the period of hospitalization**, as longer admissions lead to more payments, potentially driving up **costs**. Extended stays increase revenue without additional daily effort.
  - **Quality of care may be affected** due to reduced services per day. Skimping on daily care can compromise patient outcomes.

#### Case-Based Payment

- **Definition**: *Provider receives a predetermined fee that covers all services per case or episode of illness, which may require more than a day’s treatment.* 🧾 This method bundles services for a specific condition or treatment episode.
- **Examples**: **Maternity package** (bundling ante-, intra-, and postpartum care), **Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs)**. DRGs categorize hospital cases into groups with similar clinical and cost profiles, standardizing payments.
- **Potential Impact**: Affects **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** for hospitals. Case-based payments promote efficiency but risk under-treatment.
- **Incentives**:
  - **Providers have a strong incentive to contain costs per case**. Fixed payments encourage efficient resource use within the episode.
  - **Over-treatment and unnecessary interventions** are unlikely. Providers avoid extra procedures that don’t add value, as they aren’t separately reimbursed.
  - **Patients potentially may receive less than optimal care**, as providers may reduce the **quantity and quality of treatment** since payment is based on diagnosis. Cost-cutting could lead to minimalistic care approaches.

#### Capitation

- **Definition**: *Provider receives a fee for all services provided to one patient, usually for a period of time (e.g., the entire year).* 👨‍⚕️ This method assigns a fixed payment per patient, covering all care needs within the period.
- **Example**: A GP in the United Kingdom receives one fee from the NHS to look after all the healthcare needs of one patient, from routine check-ups to chronic disease management.
- **Potential Impact**: Affects **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** for doctors. Capitation emphasizes preventive care but introduces selection risks.
- **Incentives**:
  - **Providers have a strong incentive to contain costs per case**. Fixed payments encourage efficient care delivery and preventive measures to reduce future costs.
  - **Over-treatment and unnecessary interventions** are unlikely. Providers focus on essential care to stay within the budget.
  - **Adverse selection of patients**: Doctors may turn away **sick patients** who cost more to treat, preferring healthier patients to minimize expenses.

#### Salary

- **Definition**: *Provider receives a fixed fee for all the services provided in one month, regardless of the number of patients or services provided.* 📅 This method offers stable income, decoupling payment from service volume.
- **Potential Impact**: Affects **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** for doctors. Salaries ensure consistent care access but may reduce efficiency.
- **Incentives**:
  - **Patients are unlikely to be denied needed care**. Fixed income removes financial incentives to limit services, ensuring equitable access.
  - **Doctors lack incentive to contain costs**, which may drive up costs. Without cost-saving pressures, spending may increase.
  - **Lack incentive to be productive**, potentially lowering efficiency. Doctors may see fewer patients or spend less time optimizing care delivery.

#### Global Budget

- **Definition**: *Hospital receives a fixed budget for all the services provided in one year, regardless of the number of patients or services provided.* 🏢 This method allocates a lump sum to cover all hospital operations annually.
- **Potential Impact**: Affects **cost**, **quality**, and **quantity of care** for hospitals. Global budgets promote system-wide planning but risk resource constraints.
- **Incentives**:
  - **Hospital has a strong incentive to contain costs**. Fixed funding forces careful resource allocation to stay within budget.
  - **Controls behavior of doctors** to align with budget constraints. Hospitals may impose guidelines to limit unnecessary procedures.
  - **May impact the quality of care**, potentially leading to rationing or reduced access. Budget limits could result in fewer services or longer wait times.

#### Table: Provider Payment Mechanisms

| **Payment Method**  | **Unit of Payment**    | **Pros**                                 | **Cons**                          |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Fee-for-Service** | Per visit/procedure    | Optimal care, no denial of complex cases | Provider-induced demand           |
| **Per Diem**        | Per day                | Efficiency per day                       | Longer stays, reduced quality     |
| **Case-Based**      | Per case/diagnosis     | Cost containment, less over-treatment    | Under-treatment, lower quality    |
| **Capitation**      | Per patient per period | Cost containment, less over-treatment    | Adverse selection                 |
| **Salary**          | Per month              | No denial of care                        | No cost control, low productivity |
| **Global Budget**   | Annual allocation      | Cost control, system planning            | Rationing, quality concerns       |

### 🌟 Why Payment Mechanisms Matter

**Provider payment mechanisms** are more than financial tools; they shape the behavior of healthcare providers and, by extension, the experiences of patients. Each method carries trade-offs: **fee-for-service** ensures comprehensive care but risks overuse, while **capitation** and **global budgets** control costs but may limit access or quality. The **principal-agent problem** in fee-for-service highlights the challenges of aligning provider incentives with patient needs, particularly when information asymmetry exists. By carefully selecting and blending these mechanisms, healthcare systems can balance **cost control**, **care quality**, and **equitable access**, addressing the complex demands of modern healthcare delivery.

## 🛡️ 8. Insurance and Moral Hazard

**Insurance** is a cornerstone of modern healthcare systems, designed to shield individuals from the financial burden of medical costs. However, it introduces complex challenges, notably **moral hazard**, which can drive up healthcare utilization and costs. This section explores the **definition and mechanics of insurance**, the role of **third-party payers**, the concept and mechanisms of **moral hazard**, and strategies to mitigate its effects. By understanding these dynamics, students can appreciate how insurance shapes healthcare demand and the policies needed to balance access with cost control.

### 📖 What is Insurance?

**Definition**: *Insurance is a prepayment into a common fund that pays providers for future healthcare needs, protecting the patient against financial loss.* 🛡️ Insurance operates as a risk-sharing mechanism, where individuals contribute regular payments to a pool that covers medical expenses when needed.

- **Key Feature**: **Insured individuals** do not bear the full **financial risk** if they fall ill and require healthcare, as they **do not need to pay more** at the point of service 💸. This reduces the immediate cost barrier, making care more accessible but potentially increasing demand.

### 💰 Financial Risk and Third-Party Payers

**Effect of Third-Party Payers**:
- **Insured do not pay directly for the full cost of care**, with costs covered by **insurers** or other payers. Instead of patients footing the bill at the point of service, insurers (or entities like governments) handle payments, lowering out-of-pocket expenses.
- This reduces **financial barriers**, leading to **increased demand** and **higher system costs**. When care feels “free” or low-cost, patients may seek more services, from routine check-ups to elective procedures.

- **Moral Hazard Effect**: A significant consequence of third-party payment systems. By insulating patients from costs, these systems can lead to overuse, a phenomenon known as **moral hazard**, which poses challenges for cost control.

### ⚠️ Moral Hazard

**Definition**: *Moral hazard occurs when a party insulated from risk behaves differently than it would behave if it were fully exposed to the risk.* ❗ In healthcare, this means that insured individuals or providers may act in ways that increase service use because they face reduced financial consequences.

- **Applying to Health Insurance**:
  - The **existence of insurance cover** changes the behavior of the insured because they no longer have to bear the **full financial risk** when consuming healthcare services. With costs covered, patients may seek care more readily.
  - In most instances, this **increases the use of healthcare services** and thus **increases costs**. Overuse can strain healthcare systems, driving up premiums or public spending.

### 🔄 Mechanisms of Moral Hazard

**Moral hazard** manifests through several mechanisms, each reflecting how reduced financial risk alters behavior:

- **Change of Behavior**:
  - Insured individuals may indulge in **risky behaviors** (e.g., drink driving, risky sexual behaviors). Knowing that medical costs are covered, they may take greater health risks, increasing the likelihood of needing care.
- **Information Asymmetry**:
  - Insured may withhold information on **past medical conditions** (e.g., past history of myocardial infarct). By not disclosing health risks, they secure coverage at lower premiums, potentially leading to higher claims.
- **Decreased Payment at Point of Usage**:
  - Since **payment is made by insurers** and not patients, patients have **no incentives to control use and control costs**. Without direct financial stakes, patients may seek unnecessary consultations or treatments.
  - This is **less likely to apply when demand is inelastic** (e.g., essential treatments). For critical care, like life-saving surgery, patients would seek treatment regardless of cost, minimizing moral hazard.

### 📉 Moral Hazard and Demand Types

The extent of **moral hazard** depends on whether demand is **elastic** or **inelastic**, as these determine how sensitive patients are to price changes.

- **Inelastic Demand**:
  - **Example**: Insulin for treatment of **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus**. Patients with this condition require insulin regardless of cost due to its life-sustaining nature.
  - **Quantity does not change with price**, leading to **no appreciable moral hazard**. Even with insurance, usage remains constant because the need is non-negotiable.
- **Elastic Demand**:
  - **Example**: GP visits for a fever. These visits are often discretionary, as patients may recover without medical intervention.
  - **Without Insurance**:
    - Patients need to pay **price $P_1$**, resulting in **demand of $Q_1$ visits**. The cost deters some visits, limiting utilization.
  - **With Insurance**:
    - **No payment up front** (marginal price = 0, as the price is paid by the insurer). Insurance covers the cost, making care effectively free at the point of use.
    - **Price = 0**, increasing **demand to $Q_2$ visits**. Patients seek more visits, as the financial barrier is removed.
  - **Graphical Representation**:
    - The demand curve shifts right as the effective price drops to zero, reflecting increased consumption due to reduced cost barriers. Graphically, the demand curve for GP visits moves from quantity $Q_1$ at price $P_1$ to quantity $Q_2$ at price 0, illustrating the surge in utilization.

#### Table: Elastic vs. Inelastic Demand

| **Demand Type** | **Example**                          | **Moral Hazard Risk** |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Inelastic**   | Insulin for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus | Low                   |
| **Elastic**     | GP visits for mild fever             | High                  |

- **Note**: Elastic demand is **more sensitive to price changes**, making it more prone to **moral hazard**. Services with flexible demand, like minor consultations, see greater overuse when insured.

### 📋 Terminology in Health Insurance

Understanding **health insurance** requires familiarity with key terms that define how coverage and costs are structured:

| **Term**         | **Definition**                                                                                                             |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Premium**      | Amount paid for specified coverage. This is the regular payment (e.g., monthly) to maintain insurance.                   |
| **Coverage**     | Specified benefits that can be obtained. This outlines what services (e.g., hospital stays, doctor visits) are included.   |
| **Cost Sharing** | Sharing of costs between insured and insurer. Patients and insurers split expenses to align incentives.                  |
| **Deductible**   | Shared payment specified as fixed amounts paid by insured over a period of time (e.g., a year) before insurer cost-shares. For example, paying $500 annually before coverage kicks in. |
| **Coinsurance**  | Shared payment specified as a percentage of costs. For instance, patients pay 20% of a hospital bill, with insurers covering 80%. |
| **Copayments**   | Fixed amount needed to be paid each time before insured receives care. For example, a $20 fee per doctor visit.          |

These terms clarify how insurance structures financial responsibilities, influencing patient behavior and system costs.

### 🌐 Other Third-Party Payers

Beyond private insurers, other entities act as **third-party payers**, similarly affecting demand:

- **Employers**:
  - Employees may be covered under **employment benefits**. Companies often provide health insurance as part of compensation packages.
  - Companies may **self-insure** or **purchase insurance coverage**. Self-insuring involves setting aside funds to cover employee healthcare, while purchasing coverage involves contracting with insurers.
  - **Similar moral hazard issues** as direct health insurance apply 🏢. Employees may overuse services, knowing costs are covered by their employer’s plan.
- **Government**:
  - Provides **public provision and financing of healthcare**. In systems like Malaysia’s public healthcare, the government subsidizes care, reducing patient costs.
  - **Moral hazard issues still exist** due to reduced patient costs at the point of service 🏛️. Subsidized care can lead to increased utilization, straining public budgets.

### 🛠️ Mechanisms to Overcome Moral Hazard

- **Problem**: **Moral hazard will lead to higher insurance pay-outs** due to increased healthcare utilization. Overuse inflates costs for insurers, potentially raising premiums or taxing public systems.
- **Solution**: Ensure that **care is no longer free at the point of usage** to align patient incentives with cost control. Introducing patient cost-sharing discourages unnecessary care.
- **Mechanisms**:
  - **Copayments**: Fixed amount paid per visit. For example, a $15 fee per consultation encourages patients to weigh the necessity of each visit.
  - **Coinsurance**: Percentage-based cost sharing (e.g., 20% of costs). Patients pay a portion of the bill, incentivizing cost-conscious decisions.
  - **Deductibles**: Fixed amounts paid by the insured over a period before insurer cost-shares. For instance, paying $1,000 annually before insurance covers costs ensures patients share initial expenses.
- **Purpose**: Encourage **responsible consumption** and reduce overuse 🔐. These mechanisms restore some financial accountability, curbing excessive demand while maintaining access to essential care.

#### Table: Mechanisms to Mitigate Moral Hazard

| **Mechanism**    | **Description**                              | **Example**                          | **Effect**                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Copayments**   | Fixed fee per visit                          | $15 per doctor visit                 | Discourages unnecessary consultations          |
| **Coinsurance**  | Percentage of costs paid by patient          | 20% of hospital bill                 | Encourages cost-conscious care choices         |
| **Deductibles**  | Fixed amount paid annually before coverage   | $1,000 per year before insurer pays  | Reduces initial overuse by sharing cost burden |

### 🌟 Why Insurance and Moral Hazard Matter

**Insurance** is a double-edged sword: it protects patients from financial ruin but can inflate healthcare demand through **moral hazard**. The distinction between **elastic** and **inelastic demand** highlights why discretionary services are more prone to overuse, while **third-party payers** like employers and governments amplify these effects. By implementing **copayments**, **coinsurance**, and **deductibles**, healthcare systems can mitigate moral hazard, ensuring that insurance supports access without compromising sustainability. These insights are crucial for designing policies that balance affordability, equity, and efficiency in healthcare delivery.

### 🔍 Elaboration on Key Takeaways

To deepen understanding, let’s explore each theme and its **key takeaway**, connecting the recap to the lecture’s broader concepts:

- **Demand for Health**:
  - **Key Takeaway**: Derived from the demand for utility, with health as a durable capital good 💡. Health is not an end but a means to achieve **utility**—the satisfaction derived from work, leisure, or family life. As Michael Grossman’s theory posits, health is a **durable capital stock** that produces **healthy time**, driving individuals to invest in healthcare and lifestyle choices to maintain or enhance it.

- **Rational Decision-Making**:
  - **Key Takeaway**: Consumers weigh costs vs. benefits, but healthcare’s technical nature complicates choices 🧠. While economic theory assumes consumers make informed decisions based on **costs** (e.g., price, time) and **benefits** (e.g., health gains), healthcare’s complexity—due to technical information and uncertainty—forces reliance on professionals, challenging the rational model.

- **Nature of Healthcare**:
  - **Key Takeaway**: Characterized by asymmetric information, externalities, and provider influence 🏥. Healthcare markets deviate from standard markets due to **asymmetric information** (providers know more than patients), **externalities** (e.g., vaccination benefits society), and providers’ ability to influence demand, necessitating unique policy approaches.

- **Malaysian Studies**:
  - **Key Takeaway**: Income, age, and ethnicity shape health-seeking patterns, with significant public-private differences 🇲🇾. Studies like Heller’s (1975) and Rozita et al.’s (1996) reveal that higher **income** drives preference for private care, **age** creates a U-shaped demand pattern, and **ethnicity** (e.g., Chinese favoring private care) influences choices, with Malaysia’s **public-private healthcare system** showing distinct roles.

- **Payment Mechanisms**:
  - **Key Takeaway**: Influence cost, quality, and quantity of care through provider incentives 💰. Mechanisms like **fee-for-service** encourage comprehensive care but risk overuse, while **capitation** or **global budgets** promote cost control but may compromise quality, shaping how providers deliver services.

- **Moral Hazard**:
  - **Key Takeaway**: Third-party payers distort consumer behavior, increasing healthcare use and costs ⚠️. When **third-party payers** (e.g., insurers) cover costs, patients may overuse services (especially for **elastic demand** like GP visits), inflating system costs—a phenomenon known as **moral hazard**.

- **Insurance**:
  - **Key Takeaway**: Reduces financial risk but may drive demand and costs 🛡️. **Insurance** protects against financial loss by covering healthcare costs, but by lowering out-of-pocket expenses, it can increase demand, particularly for non-essential services, necessitating careful management.

- **Cost Control Mechanisms**:
  - **Key Takeaway**: Copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles mitigate overuse 🔐. To counter **moral hazard**, **copayments** (fixed fees per visit), **coinsurance** (percentage-based cost sharing), and **deductibles** (annual cost thresholds) ensure patients share costs, encouraging responsible consumption without barring access to essential care.
