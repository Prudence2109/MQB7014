### üîë Key Insights and Themes

The lecture is structured into ten sections, each addressing a critical aspect of health financing. Below are the **key insights** from each section, presented concisely to capture the core lessons:

- **Introduction to Health Care Financing**  
  **Health care financing** ensures resources are mobilized, pooled, and allocated to deliver care while protecting individuals from financial hardship. The lecture‚Äôs objectives include defining **health systems**, explaining **financing systems**, examining **financing options** (e.g., taxation, insurance), and understanding **NHAs** for expenditure tracking. üó∫Ô∏è

- **Understanding Health Systems**  
  A **health system** encompasses **resources, actors, and institutions** involved in **health actions**‚Äîactivities aimed at improving or maintaining health. It consists of a **health care delivery system** (facilities and personnel) and a **health financing system** (resource mobilization and allocation), with **fundamental goals** of improving health, responding to expectations, and providing **financial protection**. üè•

- **Financial Risk Protection in Universal Health Coverage**  
  **Financial protection**, a core pillar of **UHC**, ensures direct payments for health services do not cause financial hardship. Achieved through **prepayment** (e.g., taxes, premiums) and **risk pooling** (sharing costs across populations), it reduces **financial barriers** and promotes **equitable access**. üõ°Ô∏è

- **Components of Health Financing Systems**  
  Health financing involves **revenue collection** (gathering funds from taxes, insurance, or OOP payments), **fund pooling** (managing funds to share risks), and **purchasing** (allocating funds to providers). **Passive purchasing** (e.g., paying bills) contrasts with **strategic purchasing** (e.g., performance-based payments), with **incentives** shaping provider behavior. üí∞

- **Resource Allocation and Rationing**  
  Allocation decisions prioritize **what services to provide**, **what to pay for** (using **economic evaluations**), and **who shall be covered**. **Rationing** due to resource scarcity raises **ethical implications**, balancing **equity** and **efficiency**, with the critical question: *Can rationing be avoided?* ‚öñÔ∏è

- **Analyzing Health Expenditures**  
  Comparing expenditures over time requires **inflation** adjustments (using **GDP deflators** or **CPI**), while cross-country comparisons use **exchange rates** or **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)** to account for **currency differences** and **purchasing power**. The **time value of money** underscores that a dollar‚Äôs worth changes over time. üìä

- **Modalities of Health Care Financing**  
  Countries use a mix of **general taxation** (direct/indirect taxes), **social/private insurance**, **OOP payments**, **Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs)**, and **community health financing**. Each has unique **advantages** (e.g., taxation‚Äôs **progressive** nature) and **disadvantages** (e.g., OOP‚Äôs inequity). Singapore‚Äôs model exemplifies a balanced approach. üåê

- **Factors Shaping Financing Systems**  
  Financing choices are shaped by **political/cultural context** (e.g., UK‚Äôs NHS), **socioeconomic development** (public vs. private reliance), **economic structure** (tax base), **willingness to pay**, **organizational capacity**, and **informal payments**, which can undermine systems. ü§ù

- **National Health Accounts (NHAs)**  
  **NHAs** track expenditure flows, detailing **sources**, **destinations**, and **uses** of funds. They provide **evidence** for **policy**, **planning**, and **transparency**, covering **health expenditures** (e.g., medical care, prevention) and **health-related expenditures** (e.g., training). Malaysia‚Äôs 2021 data shows significant **OOP** reliance. üìà

- **Summary: Key Takeaways**  
  Health financing aims for **risk protection**, **equity**, and **access** through **revenue collection**, **fund pooling**, and **purchasing**. Diverse **modalities** and **NHA** transparency are critical, with **PPP** and **inflation** adjustments ensuring accurate comparisons. üöÄ

## ü©∫ 2. Understanding Health Systems

Health systems are the foundation of effective healthcare delivery, orchestrating resources and actions to improve well-being while ensuring equitable access. This section provides a clear and comprehensive overview of what constitutes a **health system**, its core functions, and its overarching objectives. By exploring these concepts, students gain a solid understanding of how health systems operate and their critical role in public health. üè•üåç

### üìñ What is a Health System?

A **health system** is more than just hospitals and doctors‚Äîit‚Äôs a complex network designed to promote and maintain health across populations. The lecture defines key terms to clarify its scope:

- **Health Action**: *Any set of activities whose primary intent is to improve or maintain health.*  
  These actions range from preventive measures like vaccinations to curative treatments and health promotion campaigns. ü©∫
- **Health System**: *The set of resources, actors, and institutions involved in the financing, regulation, and provision of health actions.*  
  This includes everything from funding mechanisms (e.g., taxes, insurance) to the people (doctors, policymakers) and organizations (hospitals, regulatory bodies) that make health actions possible.  
  - **Source**: Murray, C. J. & Frenk, J. (2000). *A framework for assessing the performance of health systems*. *Bulletin of the World Health Organization*, 78, 717‚Äì31.  

This definition highlights the **multifaceted nature** of health systems, emphasizing their role in coordinating diverse elements to achieve health goals. It sets the stage for understanding how financing and delivery work together to support these actions. üìö

### ‚öôÔ∏è Functions of a Health System

Health systems are dynamic, with interconnected components that ensure healthcare is accessible and effective. The lecture outlines the **two main components** of a health system, emphasizing their roles and interdependence:

- **Two Main Components**:  
  - **Health Care Delivery System**:  
    - Comprises the **organization of facilities and personnel** to deliver healthcare to the public.  
      This includes hospitals, clinics, and healthcare workers like doctors and nurses who provide direct care. üè®  
    - Traditionally divided into **public and private sectors**, but boundaries are now **less distinct**.  
      For example, public-private partnerships and private providers in public systems blur these lines, reflecting evolving healthcare models.  
  - **Health Financing System**:  
    - Supports delivery through **resource mobilization** and **allocation**.  
      This involves collecting funds (e.g., through taxes or insurance) and distributing them to pay for services, infrastructure, and personnel. üí∏  
- **Interlinkage**: Components are **closely interlinked** and require a **holistic approach** for effective performance.  
  The delivery system relies on financing to function, while financing decisions are shaped by the needs of the delivery system. A fragmented approach risks inefficiencies, such as underfunded hospitals or inaccessible care.  
- **Source**: Murray, C. J. & Frenk, J. (2000). *A framework for assessing healthcare systems*. *Bulletin of the World Health Organization*, 78(6), 717‚Äì31.  

| **Component**                | **Key Role**                                              | **Example**                              |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Health Care Delivery System  | Organizes facilities and personnel for healthcare delivery | Public hospitals, private clinics        |
| Health Financing System      | Mobilizes and allocates resources to support delivery      | Taxation, insurance premiums             |

This structure underscores the **symbiotic relationship** between delivery and financing, encouraging students to think about health systems as integrated ecosystems rather than isolated parts. üîÑ

### üéØ Objectives of a Health System

Health systems exist to serve populations effectively and equitably. The lecture identifies **three fundamental goals** that guide their design and evaluation:

- **Fundamental Goals**:  
  - **Improving the health** of the populations served.  
    This is the primary aim, focusing on reducing disease, extending life expectancy, and enhancing quality of life through preventive and curative measures. üå±  
  - **Responding to people‚Äôs expectations**.  
    Health systems must align with public needs and preferences, such as timely access to care or respectful treatment, to maintain trust and satisfaction. ü§ù  
  - **Providing financial protection** against the costs of ill-health.  
    A key pillar of equitable systems, this ensures that healthcare costs do not push individuals into poverty or prevent access to necessary care. üõ°Ô∏è  
- **Source**: World Health Organization (2000). *World Health Report 2000. Health Systems: Improving Performance*. Geneva: WHO.  

These objectives highlight the **multidimensional role** of health systems, balancing clinical outcomes with social and economic considerations. They also connect directly to the concept of **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)**, which emphasizes financial protection and equitable access as global health priorities. üåê

| **Objective**                     | **Focus**                                      | **Why It Matters**                          |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Improving Health                  | Enhance population health outcomes            | Reduces morbidity and mortality             |
| Responding to Expectations        | Meet public needs and preferences             | Builds trust and engagement                 |
| Providing Financial Protection    | Prevent financial hardship from health costs  | Ensures equity and access                   |

By aligning with these goals, health systems can achieve **sustainable impact**, addressing both immediate healthcare needs and long-term societal well-being. üöÄ

## üõ°Ô∏è 3. Financial Risk Protection in Universal Health Coverage

Ensuring that healthcare is accessible without plunging individuals into financial distress is a cornerstone of equitable health systems. This section explores the critical role of **financial risk protection** in achieving **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)**. By delving into the **importance of financial protection** and the mechanisms of **risk pooling and prepayment**, this section equips students with the knowledge to design and evaluate health financing systems that prioritize equity and sustainability. ü©∫üí∏

### üìã Importance of Financial Protection

Financial protection is not just a policy goal‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifeline that ensures healthcare access doesn‚Äôt come at the cost of economic ruin. The lecture emphasizes its centrality to **Universal Health Coverage**:

- **Core of Universal Health Coverage (UHC)**: *Financial protection ensures direct payments for health services do not expose people to financial hardship or threaten living standards.*  
  This means that when someone needs medical care, they aren‚Äôt forced to choose between treatment and basic necessities like food or housing. üè†  
- **Goal**: Achieve **equity** and **sustainability** in healthcare access.  
  Equity ensures that everyone, regardless of income, can access care, while sustainability ensures health systems can maintain this access over time without collapsing under financial strain. üåç  
- **Source**: World Health Organization (2010). *World Health Report 2010. Financing for universal coverage*. Geneva: WHO.  

This focus on **financial protection** underscores its role as a pillar of UHC, aiming to eliminate barriers that prevent vulnerable populations from seeking care. It‚Äôs about building a system where health is a right, not a privilege. üåü

| **Aspect**                  | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Financial Protection        | Prevents healthcare costs from causing financial hardship or poverty.          |
| Equity                      | Ensures all individuals, regardless of wealth, can access necessary care.      |
| Sustainability              | Maintains long-term viability of health systems to support ongoing access.      |

### üîÑ Risk Pooling and Prepayment

To achieve financial protection, health systems rely on mechanisms that distribute the burden of healthcare costs across populations, reducing the risk for individuals. The lecture details how **risk pooling** and **prepayment** make this possible:

- **Definition**: *Mechanisms to spread the financial risk of healthcare costs across a population.*  
  Instead of one person bearing the full cost of a medical emergency, these mechanisms ensure the financial load is shared, making care more affordable for everyone. ü§ù  
- **Mechanism**:  
  - **Prepayment**: Funds are collected in advance (e.g., taxes, insurance premiums).  
    This could be through monthly insurance contributions or taxes deducted from income, ensuring money is available before illness strikes. üí∞  
  - **Risk Pooling**: Risks are shared so no individual bears the full cost of unexpected health expenses.  
    By pooling funds, the system can cover costly treatments for a few without bankrupting them, as the contributions of many offset the needs of the few. üîÑ  
- **Key Idea**: Essential for reducing **financial barriers** and ensuring **equitable access**.  
  These mechanisms break down the economic obstacles that prevent people from seeking care, particularly for low-income groups, and promote fairness in health access. üö™  
- **Source**: World Health Organization (2010). *World Health Report 2010. Financing for universal coverage*. Geneva: WHO.  

| **Mechanism**     | **How It Works**                                      | **Impact**                                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Prepayment        | Collects funds in advance (e.g., taxes, premiums)    | Ensures funds are available before need arises |
| Risk Pooling      | Shares costs across a population                     | Reduces individual financial burden            |

This approach transforms healthcare financing from a reactive, individual burden to a proactive, collective responsibility. By spreading risk, **risk pooling and prepayment** create a safety net that aligns with the principles of UHC, ensuring that no one is left behind due to financial constraints. üõ°Ô∏è

## üí∞ 4. Components of Health Financing Systems

Health financing systems are the engine that powers healthcare delivery, ensuring funds are available, equitably distributed, and effectively utilized to meet population health needs. This section provides a detailed exploration of the **components of health financing systems**. By breaking down **what health care financing entails**, and detailing the processes of **revenue collection**, **fund pooling**, and **purchasing health services**, this section equips students with the tools to understand and analyze how health systems are funded and sustained. ü©∫üí∏

### üìñ What is Health Care Financing?

Health care financing is the lifeblood of any health system, ensuring that resources are available to deliver care while protecting individuals from financial hardship. The lecture provides a clear definition and outlines its core components:

- **Definition**: *The mobilization, pooling, and allocation of funds to cover healthcare costs.*  
  This process involves gathering money, managing it to spread risks, and directing it to providers to deliver services like hospital care, vaccinations, or public health programs. üìä  
- **Key Components**:  

| **Component**          | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Revenue Collection** | Mobilizing funds from households, organizations, governments, and donors.      |
| **Fund Pooling**       | Accumulating and managing funds to share financial risks across contributors.   |
| **Purchasing**         | Allocating funds to providers, either passively or strategically, to deliver care. |

This table summarizes the **three pillars** of health financing, each playing a distinct yet interconnected role in ensuring a health system‚Äôs functionality. Together, they form a cycle that supports equitable and sustainable healthcare delivery. üîÑ

### üè¶ Revenue Collection

The first step in health financing is gathering the funds needed to support healthcare services. The lecture details this process and its diverse sources:

- **Process**: *Collecting funds from various sources to finance healthcare.*  
  This involves tapping into multiple streams to ensure a steady flow of resources for hospitals, clinics, and public health initiatives. üí∞  
- **Examples**:  
  - **Taxation**: Direct (e.g., income tax) and indirect (e.g., sales tax).  
    For instance, income tax deductions or sales taxes on goods contribute to government health budgets. üèõÔ∏è  
  - **Insurance**: Premiums for social or private insurance.  
    Social insurance might involve mandatory contributions from employees and employers, while private insurance includes voluntary premiums paid to companies. üìë  
  - **Direct Contributions**: Out-of-pocket (OOP) payments by households.  
    These are payments made directly at the point of care, like fees for doctor visits or medicines. üí≥  
  - **Donations**: External or charitable contributions.  
    These could include international aid or local philanthropy supporting health programs. üéÅ  

| **Source**            | **Example**                     | **Role in Financing**                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Taxation              | Income tax, sales tax          | Funds public health services              |
| Insurance             | Social/private premiums        | Supports risk-sharing models              |
| Direct Contributions  | OOP payments                   | Covers immediate service costs            |
| Donations             | Charitable/aid contributions   | Supplements health budgets                |

This diverse mix of sources ensures that health systems have the financial flexibility to address varying needs, though each source comes with its own implications for equity and access. üåê

### üîÅ Fund Pooling

Once funds are collected, they must be managed to distribute financial risks effectively. The lecture explains how **fund pooling** achieves this:

- **Definition**: *Accumulation and management of revenue to ensure sharing of financial risk.*  
  Pooling involves combining funds from many contributors into a single or multiple funds to cover healthcare costs collectively. ü§ù  
- **Key Feature**: *The risk of paying for healthcare services is shared by all in the pool, not just the contributor.*  
  This means that no single individual bears the full cost of expensive treatments, as the pool absorbs the financial burden. üõ°Ô∏è  
- **Variation**:  
  - **Taxation-based Pooling**: Offers **high risk sharing** (e.g., universal coverage systems).  
    In systems like the UK‚Äôs NHS, taxes create a large pool that funds care for all, spreading risk widely. üè•  
  - **OOP Payments**: Provide **no pooling**, as individuals bear full costs.  
    When patients pay directly, there‚Äôs no risk-sharing, increasing financial vulnerability. üí∏  
- **Consideration**: Benefits of **single vs. multiple funds** in pooling efficiency.  
  A single fund (e.g., a national health fund) may simplify management and maximize risk-sharing, while multiple funds (e.g., private insurers) may offer choice but risk fragmentation. ‚öñÔ∏è  

| **Pooling Type**       | **Level of Risk Sharing** | **Example**                     |
|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Taxation-based         | High                      | Universal coverage systems      |
| OOP Payments           | None                      | Direct patient payments         |

Fund pooling is the heart of equitable financing, ensuring that healthcare costs are a shared responsibility rather than an individual burden. It‚Äôs a critical step toward achieving **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)**. üåç

### üßæ Purchasing Health Services

The final component is using pooled funds to pay for healthcare services. The lecture describes how **purchasing** works and the different approaches to it:

- **Definition**: *Allocation of funds to facilities/providers to deliver healthcare.*  
  This involves deciding how much to pay, who to pay, and for what services, such as hospital stays or preventive care. üìù  
- **Approaches**:  

| **Type**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Passive**    | Paying providers based on submitted bills with little oversight (e.g., fee-for-service). |
| **Strategic**  | Selective contracting, performance-linked payments, and quality monitoring to maximize system performance. |

- **Passive Purchasing**: Involves minimal scrutiny, such as paying hospitals based on bills submitted (e.g., fee-for-service models). This can lead to inefficiencies, like overbilling or unnecessary procedures. üòï  
- **Strategic Purchasing**: Uses deliberate strategies, such as negotiating contracts with providers, linking payments to performance, or monitoring quality, to ensure funds are used efficiently and effectively. üöÄ  
- **Incentives**: Need to be aware of **incentives** behind different payment mechanisms.  
  For example, fee-for-service may encourage providers to increase services, while capitation (fixed payments per patient) may incentivize cost control but risk under-treatment. ‚öñÔ∏è  
- **Source**: Acknowledgement to Cheryl Cashin for the passive-to-strategic purchasing framework.  

| **Approach**      | **Characteristics**                          | **Potential Impact**                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Passive           | Pays bills with little oversight             | Risks inefficiency, overbilling           |
| Strategic         | Uses contracts, performance-based payments   | Enhances efficiency, quality               |

Strategic purchasing aligns financing with health system goals, ensuring that funds translate into high-quality, accessible care. It‚Äôs a proactive approach that maximizes the value of every dollar spent. üí°

## ‚öñÔ∏è 5. Resource Allocation and Rationing

Resource allocation in healthcare is a delicate balancing act, requiring tough decisions about how to distribute limited funds and services to meet diverse population needs. This section dives into the complexities of **decision-making in allocation** and the inevitable challenges of **rationing**. By exploring the key decisions and ethical dilemmas involved, this section equips students with the tools to navigate the trade-offs between **equity**, **efficiency**, and resource scarcity in health systems. ü©∫‚öñÔ∏è

### üìã Decision-Making in Allocation

Allocating resources in a health system involves making strategic choices about where and how to direct finite funds to maximize health outcomes. The lecture outlines the **key decisions** and **challenges** that define this process:

- **Key Decisions**:  
  - **What services to provide**: Prioritizing interventions.  
    Health systems must decide which services‚Äîsuch as vaccinations, cancer treatments, or mental health programs‚Äîtake precedence based on need, impact, and cost. For example, a system might prioritize preventive care to reduce future disease burden. üíâ  
  - **What to pay for**: Using **economic evaluations** to assess alternatives.  
    Tools like cost-effectiveness analysis help determine which interventions offer the best value for money, ensuring funds are spent wisely. For instance, funding a low-cost, high-impact intervention like mosquito nets might outweigh an expensive, less effective treatment. üìä  
  - **Who shall be covered**: Determining eligible populations.  
    This involves deciding who qualifies for care, such as universal coverage for all citizens or targeted programs for vulnerable groups like the elderly or low-income families. üåç  
- **Challenges**:  
  - **Rationing of Care**: Deciding who receives limited resources due to scarcity.  
    With finite budgets and infinite needs, health systems must allocate resources selectively, often leaving some needs unmet. For example, limited hospital beds may force prioritization of critical cases over elective surgeries. üè•  
  - **Ethical Implications**: Balancing **equity** and **efficiency**.  
    Equity demands fair access for all, while efficiency seeks to maximize health gains per dollar spent. These goals can conflict, such as when funding high-cost treatments for a few reduces resources for broader preventive care. ü§ù  
  - **Can Rationing Be Avoided?**: A critical policy question.  
    The lecture poses this as a pivotal issue, challenging policymakers to explore whether innovative financing, efficiency improvements, or resource expansion can minimize or eliminate the need for rationing. üåü  

| **Decision Area**          | **Focus**                                     | **Example**                              |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| What Services to Provide   | Prioritizing interventions                    | Choosing vaccinations over elective care |
| What to Pay For            | Using economic evaluations                   | Cost-effectiveness of malaria nets       |
| Who Shall Be Covered       | Determining eligible populations             | Universal vs. targeted coverage          |

| **Challenge**              | **Description**                               | **Implication**                          |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Rationing of Care          | Allocating scarce resources                  | Some needs go unmet                      |
| Ethical Implications       | Balancing equity and efficiency              | Potential for unfair access              |
| Avoiding Rationing         | Exploring alternatives to scarcity           | Requires innovation and investment       |

These decisions and challenges highlight the **complexity of resource allocation**, where every choice carries significant health and ethical consequences. The lecture encourages students to think critically about how to align financing decisions with the broader goals of health systems, such as improving population health and ensuring financial protection. üöÄ

## üìà 6. Analyzing Health Expenditures

Understanding how much a country spends on healthcare is crucial for effective policy-making, but raw numbers can be misleading without proper adjustments. This section dives into the intricacies of **analyzing health expenditures**. It explores the challenges of comparing expenditures over time and across countries, introduces the **time value of money**, and explains how to adjust for **inflation** and **purchasing power**. With practical examples and calculations, this section equips students with the tools to interpret health spending data accurately and meaningfully. ü©∫üìä

### üîç Basics of Financing: Understanding Expenditures

To make informed decisions about health financing, we need to know exactly what a country spends on healthcare and how those figures compare over time and across borders. The lecture frames this with a central question and highlights key challenges:

- **Key Question**: *How do you know what a country spends on healthcare?*  
  This question drives the need for standardized, comparable data to assess health system performance and guide resource allocation. üìã  
- **Challenges**:  
  - Comparing expenditures across **time** requires adjusting for **inflation**.  
    Prices rise over time, so a dollar spent today isn‚Äôt equivalent to a dollar spent decades ago. Without adjustments, comparisons are distorted. ‚è≥  
  - Comparing across **countries** requires adjusting for **currency differences** and **purchasing power**.  
    A dollar in one country buys different amounts of goods and services than in another, complicating international comparisons. üåç  

These challenges underscore the importance of using robust methods to ensure health expenditure data is meaningful and actionable for policymakers. üöÄ

#### Time Value of Money

The value of money changes over time, a concept critical to understanding health expenditure trends. The lecture poses a fundamental question to illustrate this:

- **Question**: *Is a dollar today worth a dollar tomorrow?*  
  This prompts reflection on how money‚Äôs worth evolves, affecting how we interpret past and future expenditures. üí∏  
- **Answer**: No, due to **inflation** and the **time value of money**.  
  - A unit of currency is **worth more now** than in the future.  
    Inflation erodes purchasing power, so a dollar today buys more than a dollar will in years to come. üìâ  
  - A unit of currency is **worth less now** than in the past.  
    A dollar in the past could buy more goods and services than it can today due to rising prices. üìà  

This principle, known as the **time value of money**, is foundational for adjusting health expenditures to ensure fair comparisons over time, helping policymakers understand true spending trends. üîÑ

#### Adjusting for Inflation

To compare health expenditures across different years, adjustments for inflation are essential. The lecture provides tools and examples to demonstrate this process:

- **Need**: Expenditures must be adjusted for **inflation** to ensure comparability over time.  
  Without this, nominal increases in spending might reflect price rises rather than real growth in healthcare investment. üìä  
- **Tools**:  
  - **Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Deflators**: Adjusts for economy-wide price changes.  
    This tool accounts for inflation across all sectors, providing a broad measure of price shifts. üìà  
  - **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: Measures changes in consumer goods prices.  
    The CPI focuses on the cost of a basket of goods and services, offering a consumer-oriented inflation measure. üõí  
- **Example**: Total Health Expenditure (THE) in Malaysia (1997‚Äì2021):  

| **Year**     | **THE (Current RM)** | **THE (Adjusted to 2021 RM)** |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1997         | RM 8.6 billion       | RM 18.3 billion               |
| 2021         | RM 78.2 billion      | RM 78.2 billion               |
| **Increase** | 809% (current)       | 380% (adjusted)               |

  This table shows that while nominal THE grew by **809%**, the inflation-adjusted increase was **380%**, revealing the true growth in spending power. üìâ  
- **Calculation (Base Year 2021)**:  
  - For 1997:  
    $$\text{Constant 1997 THE} = \frac{111.4 \times 8.6}{52.1} = \text{RM 18.4 billion}$$  
    Using the GDP deflator, the 1997 expenditure is scaled to 2021 prices, showing its real value.  
  - For 2010:  
    $$\text{Constant 2010 THE} = \frac{111.4 \times 32.9}{90.4} = \text{RM 40.5 billion}$$  
    Similarly, 2010‚Äôs expenditure is adjusted to reflect 2021‚Äôs price levels.  
  - **GDP Deflators**: 1997 (52.1), 2010 (90.4), 2021 (111.4).  
    These deflators measure how prices have changed relative to the base year (2021). üìä  
- **Inflation Rate Example (2020‚Äì2024)**:  
  - Price of a burger: RM 6.00 (2020), RM 6.60 (2024).  
  - $$\text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{6.60 - 6.00}{6.00} = 10\%$$  
    This simple calculation illustrates how inflation increases costs over time, affecting healthcare budgets. üçî  
- **Source**: Malaysia National Health Accounts, Health Expenditure Reports (various years).  

| **Tool**            | **Purpose**                              | **Application**                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| GDP Deflators       | Adjusts for economy-wide price changes   | Broad inflation adjustment          |
| CPI                 | Measures consumer goods price changes    | Consumer-focused inflation measure  |

These tools and examples highlight the necessity of **inflation adjustments** to reveal the real trends in health spending, ensuring accurate policy insights. üîç

To illustrate Malaysia‚Äôs health expenditure trends (1997‚Äì2021), here‚Äôs a **chart** showing **Total Health Expenditure (THE)** in current and inflation-adjusted terms. ![[Pasted image 20250518215713.png]]

**Explanation**: The chart contrasts **current** and **inflation-adjusted** THE, showing a less dramatic increase when adjusted (380% vs. 809%).

#### Cross-Country Comparisons

Comparing health expenditures across countries is fraught with challenges due to currency and purchasing power differences. The lecture provides methods and examples to address these:

- **Question**: *Can a dollar buy the same amount of goods in every country?*  
  This question emphasizes that nominal spending figures are misleading without accounting for local economic contexts. üåê  
- **Challenges**:  
  - **Different currencies**.  
    Each country uses its own currency, requiring conversion to a common standard like USD. üí±  
  - **Different purchasing power** of currencies.  
    A dollar buys more in some countries than others due to varying costs of goods and services. üõçÔ∏è  
- **Adjustments**:  
  - **Official Currency Exchange Rates**: Convert to a common currency (e.g., USD).  
    This method uses market exchange rates but may not reflect true purchasing power. üìà  
  - **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Rates**: Reflects real purchasing power.  
    PPP adjusts for what a currency can actually buy, offering a more accurate comparison. üí∏  
- **Example**: National Health Expenditures (2022, per capita):  

| **Country** | **Per Capita CHE (Currency Rate, USD)** | **Per Capita CHE (PPP Rate, USD)** | **Currency**         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|
| China       | 672 (4,530 Renminbi)                    | 1,136                              | Renminbi            |
| India       | 80 (6,250 Indian Rupee)                 | 273                                | Indian Rupee        |
| Malaysia    | 458 (2,017 Ringgit)                     | 1,281                              | Ringgit             |
| Myanmar     | 58 (111,502 Myanmar Kyat)               | 242                                | Myanmar Kyat        |
| Singapore   | 4,371 (5,957 SGD)                       | 6,658                              | SGD                 |
| USA         | 12,434                                  | 12,434                             | USD                 |

  - **Source**: WHO at http://apps.who.int/nha/database/Select/Indicators/en.  
  This table shows how PPP adjustments reveal higher real spending in countries like Malaysia compared to exchange rate conversions. üìä  
- **PPP Example**: Price of a burger:  
  - Malaysia: RM 15.45  
  - USA: USD 5.35  
  - **Implied Exchange Rate**:  
    $$\text{Exchange Rate (RM to USD)} = \frac{15.45}{5.35} = \text{RM 2.89 to USD 1.00}$$  
    This reflects the cost of a standard good (a burger) in both countries. üçî  
  - **Official Rate (2022)**: RM 4.42 to USD 1.00.  
    The market exchange rate differs from the implied rate. üí±  
  - **Undervaluation**:  
    $$\text{Undervalued by} = \frac{2.89 - 4.42}{2.89} = -53\%$$  
    The Malaysian Ringgit is **undervalued by ~53%**, meaning its purchasing power is stronger than the official rate suggests. üìâ  
  - **Conclusion**: Malaysian Ringgit is **undervalued by ~53%**.  
- **Exchange Rates (2022)**:  

| **Country** | **Currency Exchange Rate (NCU/USD)** | **PPP Exchange Rate (NCU/USD)** |

| China       | 6.74                                 | 3.99                          |
| India       | 78.60                                | 22.88                         |
| Malaysia    | 4.40                                 | 1.57                          |
| Myanmar     | 1,923.48                             | 460.86                        |
| Singapore   | 1.38                                 | 0.89                          |
| USA         | 1.00                                 | 1.00                          |

  - NCU: National Currency Unit.  

| **Adjustment Method** | **Purpose**                           | **Advantage**                           |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Exchange Rates        | Converts to common currency           | Simple, market-based                    |
| PPP Rates             | Reflects real purchasing power        | More accurate for living standards      |

These adjustments ensure **cross-country comparisons** are fair and reflective of actual healthcare investment, enabling policymakers to benchmark and learn from global trends. üåç

## üíµ 7. Modalities of Health Care Financing

Health care financing is a complex puzzle, with countries piecing together various methods to fund their health systems effectively. This section explores the diverse **modalities of health care financing**. From **general taxation** to **community-based initiatives**, this section provides a comprehensive overview of how nations mobilize resources to ensure healthcare access while addressing equity and sustainability. With real-world examples and detailed analyses, students gain insights into the strengths, challenges, and ethical considerations of each financing approach. ü©∫üí∞

### üìã Overview

No single financing method dominates globally; instead, countries rely on a **combination of financing modalities**, each contributing in **relative proportions** based on local contexts. The lecture introduces the main modalities, setting the stage for a deeper exploration:

- Countries use a **combination of financing modalities**, differing in their **relative proportions**. The main modalities include:  
  - **General taxation**  
  - **Social insurance**  
  - **Private insurance**  
  - **Out-of-pocket (OOP) payments**  
  - **Others**: Medical Savings Accounts, Community Health Financing  

This mix reflects the unique **political, cultural, and socioeconomic** factors shaping each country‚Äôs health system, ensuring flexibility but also introducing complexity in achieving equitable access. üåç

| **Modality**                   | **Key Feature**                              |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| General Taxation               | Funds from direct/indirect taxes             |
| Social Insurance               | Mandatory contributions for risk pooling     |
| Private Insurance              | Voluntary, market-based coverage             |
| Out-of-Pocket Payments         | Direct payments by individuals               |
| Medical Savings Accounts       | Individual savings for healthcare            |
| Community Health Financing     | Community-driven, voluntary contributions    |

#### General Taxation

Taxation is a cornerstone of public health financing, channeling government revenue into social programs like healthcare. The lecture details its structure, benefits, and limitations:

- **Definition**: *Funds collected through direct (e.g., income tax) or indirect (e.g., sales tax) taxes to finance social programs like health and education.*  
  Taxes provide a broad revenue base to support universal or targeted health services. üèõÔ∏è  
- **Categories**:  
  - **Direct Taxes**: E.g., income tax.  
    These are levied on individual or corporate earnings, often structured to reflect income levels.  
  - **Indirect Taxes**: E.g., sales tax on goods and services.  
    Applied to purchases, these taxes are paid by all consumers but can disproportionately affect lower-income groups. üõí  
- **Advantages**:  
  - **Progressive Taxation**:  
    - **Progressive Tax System**: *Taxes rise as a proportion of income as income rises.*  
      Higher earners pay a larger share, promoting fairness.  
    - **Regressive Tax System**: *Taxes fall as a proportion of income as income rises.*  
      Lower earners bear a heavier burden relative to income.  
    - **Proportional System**: *Taxes are the same proportion of income for all, irrespective of income.*  
      Everyone pays the same rate, regardless of wealth.  
    - **Example**:  
      - Mr. A: Pays RM 100 for healthcare, earns RM 1,000/month (10% of income).  
      - Mr. B: Pays RM 200 for healthcare, earns RM 4,000/month (5% of income).  
      - **Analysis**: This is **regressive**, as the lower-income individual pays a higher proportion.  
        This example illustrates how payment structures can undermine equity if not carefully designed. üìâ  
  - **Social Justice**:  
    - Acts as an **instrument** to achieve equitable wealth distribution.  
      Taxes redistribute resources to fund public services, reducing disparities.  
    - Supports **vulnerable groups** (e.g., poor, elderly).  
      Subsidized care ensures access for those who can‚Äôt afford it.  
    - Funds **public goods** (non-rivalrous, non-excludable, e.g., lighthouses, health information, clean air) and **merit goods** (under-consumed by market, e.g., vaccines, vector control, screening programs).  
      These goods benefit society broadly, justifying public investment. üå±  
  - **Political Will**: Required for progressive implementation.  
    Progressive systems need strong governance to overcome resistance from high earners or political opponents. üó≥Ô∏è  
- **Disadvantages**:  
  - **Revenue Variability**: Depends on:  
    - **Wealth of the country**.  
      Poorer nations struggle to generate sufficient tax revenue.  
    - **Taxable base**.  
      A small working population limits funds.  
    - **Competition** with other national needs (e.g., defense).  
      Health competes with other priorities, reducing available funds.  
    - **Fluctuates** year to year.  
      Economic downturns can shrink tax revenue, destabilizing health budgets. üìâ  
  - **Inadequate Funds**: May not meet healthcare demands.  
    Rising costs or population growth can outpace tax revenue.  
  - **Reliance on Indirect Taxes**: Often **regressive**, burdening the poor and those less able to pay.  
    Sales taxes, for example, hit low-income households harder, undermining equity. üòï  
- **Examples**:  
  - **Hospital Authority** in Hong Kong.  
    Public hospitals are funded through taxation, providing affordable care.  
  - **Public health services** in Malaysia.  
    Government clinics and hospitals rely heavily on tax revenue. üè•  

| **Tax Type**     | **Example**         | **Impact**                          |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Direct Taxes     | Income tax          | Progressive, supports equity        |
| Indirect Taxes   | Sales tax           | Regressive, burdens lower-income     |

#### Health Insurance

Insurance systems protect individuals from the financial unpredictability of illness by spreading costs across a group. The lecture outlines its mechanics and types:

- **Definition**: *Provides protection against the uncertainty of ill-health and associated financial costs through risk pooling.*  
  Insurance cushions the financial blow of medical expenses, making care more accessible. üõ°Ô∏è  
- **Mechanism**:  
  - **Risk Pooling**: Spreads risk across the insured population.  
    Contributions from many cover the costs of the few who need care, reducing individual burdens. üîÑ  
  - **Predictability**: While individual ill-health is uncertain, group-level patterns can be predicted.  
    Actuarial data helps insurers estimate costs, ensuring fund stability. üìä  
- **Categories**:  
  - **Private Health Insurance**: Market-based, voluntary, or employer-sponsored.  
    Individuals or companies pay premiums for coverage, often tailored to specific needs.  
  - **Social Health Insurance**: Government-backed, often mandatory with contributions from employers and employees.  
    Common in countries like Germany, it ensures broad coverage through compulsory participation. ü§ù  

| **Insurance Type** | **Features**                          | **Example**                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Private            | Voluntary, market-driven              | Employer-sponsored plans        |
| Social             | Mandatory, government-backed          | Germany‚Äôs statutory insurance   |

#### Out-of-Pocket (OOP) Household Expenditures

Direct payments by individuals are a common but problematic financing method. The lecture highlights their role and risks:

- **Definition**: *Any payments made directly to healthcare providers, including user fees and payments for medicines.*  
  These are immediate costs borne by patients at the point of care, like consultation fees or drug purchases. üí≥  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - Coexists with other schemes (e.g., co-payments in insurance, user fees in public services).  
    Even in insured or public systems, patients may face additional costs.  
  - **Over-reliance** can **decrease accessibility** for the poor, undermining equity.  
    High OOP costs deter low-income individuals from seeking care, exacerbating health disparities. üòî  

| **OOP Feature**       | **Impact**                                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Coexists with Schemes | Adds costs in insured/public systems        |
| Over-reliance         | Reduces access for poor, harms equity       |

#### Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs)

MSAs offer a personalized approach to health financing, encouraging individual responsibility. The lecture details their structure and challenges:

- **Definition**: *Individual savings accounts restricted to spending on healthcare.*  
  These accounts set aside funds specifically for medical expenses, promoting savings discipline. üí∏  
- **Context**: Exists within a country‚Äôs broader financing system.  
  MSAs complement other modalities like insurance or taxation.  
- **Examples**:  
  - **Singapore**: **Medisave**, a medical savings account component of the **Central Provident Fund (CPF)**.  
    Workers contribute to Medisave for healthcare costs, integrated into a national savings scheme.  
  - **Malaysia (pre-2007)**: **Employees Provident Fund (EPF)** savings earmarked for critical illness expenses.  
    A portion of savings was allocated for severe health conditions.  
  - Others: South Africa, USA.  
    Similar schemes exist in various forms globally. üåç  
- **Malaysia EPF Details**:  
  - Established under **EPF Ordinance 1951**.  
    A compulsory savings scheme for employment benefits like retirement.  
  - Compulsory savings scheme for employment benefits.  
    Mandated contributions ensure long-term financial security.  
  - Secondary role as an **alternative financing source** for healthcare.  
    Health was a supplementary focus before changes.  
  - **1994 Restructuring**: Created individual savings accounts for **critical illness expenses** for members and dependents.  
    This allowed targeted use for severe conditions.  
  - **Abolished in 2007**: Health-specific accounts discontinued.  
    Malaysia shifted away from this model, favoring other financing methods.  
- **Issue**: Uncertainty about whether individuals can **save enough** for all healthcare needs.  
  Chronic or catastrophic illnesses may exceed savings, posing risks. üòü  
- **Linkage**: Often paired with **catastrophic insurance** to cover large, unexpected expenses.  
  This hybrid approach mitigates the limitations of MSAs alone. üõ°Ô∏è  

| **MSA Aspect**         | **Detail**                              | **Challenge**                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Purpose                | Restricted healthcare savings           | Limited by savings capacity       |
| Example                | Singapore‚Äôs Medisave                    | Requires supplementary insurance  |

#### Community Health Financing

In areas where formal systems falter, communities step in to fill the gap. The lecture explores this grassroots approach:

- **Context**: Prevalent in **rural areas** of **low-income countries** where market and public systems fail to provide access.  
  These regions often lack infrastructure or government support, necessitating local solutions. üåæ  
- **Features**:  
  - **Mainly voluntary**.  
    Participation is driven by community initiative, not mandate.  
  - **Payment for healthcare** made by the community.  
    Funds are pooled locally to cover members‚Äô needs.  
  - **Community control** of resources and their management.  
    Locals decide how funds are used, fostering trust and accountability. ü§ù  
- **Mechanisms**: Often based on **social insurance** principles.  
  Community schemes mimic insurance by pooling risks, but on a smaller, local scale.  
- **Examples**:  
  - **SEWA, Gujarat, India**: Health, life, and asset insurance for women working in the informal sector.  
    This empowers women with affordable coverage.  
  - **Grameen Bank Health Programme, Bangladesh**: Benefits for Grameen Bank members.  
    Microfinance members access health services through group contributions.  
  - **Bamako Initiative**: Revolving fund for essential drugs.  
    Communities manage drug supplies, ensuring availability. üíä  

| **Example**               | **Focus**                              | **Region**         |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|
| SEWA, India               | Informal sector women                  | Gujarat            |
| Grameen Bank, Bangladesh  | Microfinance members                   | Bangladesh         |
| Bamako Initiative         | Essential drug access                  | Various countries  |

#### Health Financing in Singapore

Singapore‚Äôs health financing model is a global benchmark, blending multiple modalities for efficiency and equity. The lecture details its components:

- **Sources of Funds**:  

| **Source**                        | **Description**                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **General Taxation**              | Government provides subsidies in restructured health facilities. |
| **Medisave**                      | Medical savings account component of Central Provident Fund.     |
| **MediShield**                    | Public catastrophic illness insurance.                           |
| **MediFund**                      | Endowment fund for the poor.                                     |
| **ElderShield & CareShield Life** | Disability insurance for long-term care.                         |
| **Out-of-Pocket Payments**        | Direct payments by individuals.                                  |

This multi-layered approach combines **public subsidies**, **individual savings**, **insurance**, and **targeted support** for the vulnerable, showcasing a balanced and sustainable system. üåü

## üß≠ 8. Factors Shaping Financing Systems

Health care financing systems are not one-size-fits-all; they are molded by a country‚Äôs unique circumstances, from its political ideals to its economic realities. This section explores the **determinants of financing choices** that shape how nations fund their health systems. By examining the interplay of **political, cultural, socioeconomic**, and organizational factors, this section equips students with a nuanced understanding of why health financing systems vary globally and how they can be tailored to local needs. ü©∫üåç

### üìã Determinants of Financing Choices

The choice of health financing modalities‚Äîwhether taxation, insurance, or out-of-pocket payments‚Äîis influenced by a complex web of factors. The lecture outlines these **multiple factors**, providing a framework to analyze why countries adopt different approaches:

- **Multiple Factors**:  
  - **Political and Cultural Context**: E.g., the UK‚Äôs **NHS** reflects a social philosophy of universal access.  
    The National Health Service embodies a commitment to healthcare as a right, driven by political will and cultural values prioritizing equity. This contrasts with systems favoring individual responsibility, like in the USA. üèõÔ∏è  
  - **Socioeconomic Development**:  
    - **Low-Income Countries**: Higher reliance on **private sources**, especially **OOP payments**.  
      Limited government resources force individuals to pay directly, often leading to financial hardship. üí∏  
    - **High-Income Countries**: Greater use of **public sources** (e.g., taxation, social insurance).  
      Wealthier nations can leverage taxes or mandatory contributions to fund comprehensive systems.  
    - Ability to obtain funds correlates with **per capita income**.  
      Higher incomes mean more taxable revenue and greater capacity to support public health programs. üìà  
  - **Economic Structure**: A larger working population increases the **tax base**.  
    Countries with more employed individuals can collect more taxes or insurance contributions, strengthening financing systems. For example, a youthful workforce supports a robust tax base, unlike aging populations with fewer workers. üë∑  
  - **Population‚Äôs Willingness to Pay**: Trust and acceptance of pooling funds.  
    Citizens must trust that their contributions (e.g., taxes or premiums) will translate into quality care, or resistance to pooling may arise. Public confidence is key to successful financing. ü§ù  
  - **Organizational Capacity**: Efficient and effective **fund collection** from employees, employers, and other groups.  
    Strong administrative systems ensure funds are collected and managed transparently, minimizing leakage or corruption. üìä  
  - **Role of Informal Payments**: Can undermine formal financing systems.  
    In some countries, patients pay unofficial fees to access care, bypassing formal channels and eroding trust in the system. This practice can destabilize equitable financing models. üòï  

| **Factor**                     | **Influence on Financing**                              | **Example**                              |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Political/Cultural Context     | Shapes philosophy (e.g., universal access)             | UK‚Äôs NHS                                 |
| Socioeconomic Development      | Determines reliance on public vs. private sources      | OOP in low-income countries              |
| Economic Structure             | Larger workforce = bigger tax base                     | Youthful populations                     |
| Willingness to Pay             | Trust drives acceptance of pooling                    | Public support for taxes                 |
| Organizational Capacity        | Ensures efficient fund collection                      | Strong tax systems                       |
| Informal Payments              | Undermines formal systems                             | Unofficial fees in some countries        |

These determinants highlight the **context-specific nature** of health financing. For instance, a low-income country with a small tax base and weak governance may lean on OOP payments, while a high-income country with strong institutions can sustain a tax-funded system like the NHS. Understanding these factors helps policymakers design financing systems that align with their country‚Äôs realities, balancing **equity**, **efficiency**, and **sustainability**. üöÄ

## üìä 9. National Health Accounts (NHAs)

Tracking how money flows through a health system is essential for understanding its performance and making informed policy decisions. This section dives into **National Health Accounts (NHAs)**, a powerful tool for mapping health expenditure flows. By exploring their **definition**, **structure**, **scope**, and application in Malaysia, this section equips students with the knowledge to analyze health spending and its implications for equity, efficiency, and sustainability. ü©∫üìà

### üìñ What are National Health Accounts?

National Health Accounts provide a clear, systematic snapshot of a country‚Äôs health spending, revealing who pays, who receives, and what services are funded. The lecture defines their role and purpose:

- **Definition**: *A set of descriptive accounts that describe the totality of expenditure flows in both government and non-government sectors, detailing the source, destination, and uses of funds in the health sector.*  
  NHAs act like a financial GPS, mapping every dollar spent on healthcare, from taxes to private insurance, and tracking where it goes‚Äîhospitals, clinics, or public health programs. üó∫Ô∏è  
- **Purpose**:  
  - Answers key questions:  
    - *Who paid, who did they pay to, and what did they get for their payment?*  
      For example, did taxes fund hospital care, or did patients pay out-of-pocket for medicines?  
    - *How are resources used, for what services, and for whom?*  
      This reveals whether funds prioritize curative care, prevention, or specific groups like the elderly.  
  - Provides **evidence** to help **policymakers**, **nongovernmental stakeholders**, and **managers** make better decisions to improve **health system performance**.  
    By offering data-driven insights, NHAs guide resource allocation, policy reforms, and efforts to enhance equity and efficiency. üìä  

| **Aspect**         | **Role of NHAs**                                      |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Tracks Flows       | Maps sources, destinations, and uses of funds         |
| Answers Questions  | Who pays, who receives, and what services are funded  |
| Supports Decisions | Provides evidence for policy and management           |

### üåê System of Health Accounts

NHAs are not just local tools; they‚Äôre part of a global framework for comparable health expenditure data. The lecture explains their standardized structure:

- **Developed by**: **OECD**, used by many countries, including Malaysia.  
  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) pioneered this system, ensuring consistency across nations. üåç  
- **Features**:  
  - Provides **internationally comparable health accounts** through **standard tables**.  
    These tables allow countries to benchmark their spending against others, fostering global learning.  
  - Defines **internationally harmonized boundaries** of healthcare.  
    This ensures that only health-related expenditures are counted, avoiding discrepancies in what qualifies as ‚Äúhealth spending.‚Äù üìã  
- **Sources**:  
  - Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Eurostat, & World Health Organization (2017). *A System of Health Accounts 2011. Revised Edition*. Paris: OECD.  
  - Ministry of Health Malaysia (2006). *Malaysia National Health Accounts Project. Report on the MNHA Classification System (MNHA Framework)*. Putrajaya: MOH Malaysia.  

| **Feature**                  | **Benefit**                                     |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Standard Tables              | Enables global comparisons                     |
| Harmonized Boundaries        | Ensures consistent definitions of health spending |

This standardized approach makes NHAs a cornerstone of global health economics, allowing Malaysia and other nations to align their data with international best practices. üöÄ

### üìà What Constitutes Health Expenditures?

Not all spending counts as ‚Äúhealth expenditure‚Äù‚ÄîNHAs define clear boundaries to ensure accuracy. The lecture outlines what‚Äôs included:

- **Definition**: *Health spending consists of health and health-related expenditures, defined by their primary purpose, regardless of the entity providing or paying for the services.*  
  Whether funded by governments, individuals, or NGOs, spending must aim to improve health to qualify. üí∏  
- **Scope**:  
  - Includes **health of individuals** and **populations**.  
    This covers personal care (e.g., doctor visits) and collective efforts (e.g., vaccination campaigns).  
  - Covers **medical care**, **prevention**, **promotion**, **rehabilitation**, **community health activities**, **health administration**, **regulation**, and **capital formation**.  
    From hospital treatments to building new clinics, these categories capture the full spectrum of health activities. üè•  
- **Health-Related Expenditures**: Include **medical education**, **training**, and **research and development**.  
  These support the health system indirectly by building capacity and innovation. üìö  
- **Malaysia‚Äôs Definition**:  
  - **Current Expenditure on Health Care**: *Final consumption expenditure of resident units on healthcare goods and services, including both individual and collective healthcare services.*  
    This focuses on spending for immediate use, like consultations or public health programs, rather than long-term investments.  
- **OECD Definition**: Aligns with Malaysia‚Äôs framework for comparability.  
  Malaysia adopts OECD standards to ensure its data is globally consistent.  
- **Source**: Ministry of Health Malaysia (2006). *Malaysia National Health Accounts Project. Report on the MNHA Classification System (MNHA Framework)*. Putrajaya: MOH Malaysia.  

| **Category**                  | **Examples**                                   |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Health Expenditures           | Medical care, prevention, rehabilitation       |
| Health-Related Expenditures   | Medical education, R&D                         |

### üìä Malaysian Health Spending (2021)

Malaysia‚Äôs health spending provides a real-world case study of NHAs in action. The lecture presents detailed 2021 data, highlighting key metrics and trends:

- **Total Health Expenditure (THE)**:  
  - **RM 78.2 billion**, or **5.1% of GDP**.  
    This reflects Malaysia‚Äôs significant investment in health relative to its economy.  
  - **Per Capita THE**: RM 2,401.  
    On average, each Malaysian‚Äôs health spending equates to this amount annually. üí∞  
- **Current Health Expenditure (CHE)**:  
  - **RM 68.0 billion**, or **4.4% of GDP**.  
    CHE focuses on immediate consumption, excluding capital investments like new hospitals.  
  - **Per Capita CHE**: RM 2,089.  
    This represents the per-person spending on current health services. üìà  
- **Out-of-Pocket Payments (OOPPs)**:  
  - **THE**: RM 24.6 billion, or **31.5% of THE**.  
    Nearly a third of total spending comes directly from individuals.  
  - **CHE**: RM 23.1 billion, or **34.1% of CHE**.  
    OOPPs constitute an even higher share of current spending, highlighting reliance on direct payments.  
  - **Per Capita OOPP**: RM 756 (THE), RM 711 (CHE).  
    Each Malaysian pays this amount out-of-pocket annually, a significant burden for lower-income groups. üòü  
- **Sources of Health Financing (1997‚Äì2021)**:  
  - Mix of **public** (e.g., taxation) and **private** (e.g., OOP, insurance) sources.  
    Malaysia balances government funding with individual contributions.  
  - Trend shows increasing **THE as % of GDP**, with fluctuations in public vs. private contributions.  
    Health spending has grown, but the public-private mix shifts over time, reflecting policy changes. üìä  
- **THE by Function (2011‚Äì2021)**:  

| **Function**                    | **Share (2021)** | **Trend (2011‚Äì2021)**  |
|---------------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Curative Care Services**      | ~31.0%           | Stable, ~30%           |
| **Public Health Services**      | 13.1%            | 8.7‚Äì13.1%              |
| **Medical Goods (Outpatient)**  | 13.0%            | ~10‚Äì13%                |
| **Health Administration**       | 9.7%             | ~9‚Äì10%                 |
| **Rehabilitative Care**         | ~5‚Äì10%           | Variable               |
| **Long-term Nursing Care**      | ~1‚Äì2%            | Low, stable            |
| **Ancillary Services**          | ~5‚Äì10%           | Variable               |
| **Health-Related Expenditures** | ~10‚Äì15%          | Includes R&D, training |

  Curative care dominates, reflecting a focus on treatment, while public health and administration are also significant. üè•  
- **OOPPs by Function (2011‚Äì2021)**:  

| **Function**                             | **Share (2021)** | **Trend (2011‚Äì2021)** |
|------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| **Outpatient Services**                  | 6.0%             | 6.0‚Äì10.2%             |
| **Pharmaceuticals**                      | 6.9%             | 6.7‚Äì8.4%              |

### üìã Core Insights for Health Financing

The lecture‚Äôs key takeaways are presented in a structured table, encapsulating the critical areas of health financing. Each area highlights a **key insight** that ties together the concepts explored throughout the lecture:

| **Area**                     | **Key Insight**                                                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Health Financing Goals**   | Achieve **risk protection**, **equity**, and **access** through effective systems. |
| **Mechanisms**               | **Revenue collection**, **fund pooling**, and **purchasing** are core components. |
| **Modalities**               | Include **taxation**, **insurance**, **OOP payments**, **MSAs**, and **community financing**. |
| **Comparisons**              | Adjust expenditures using **PPP** and **inflation** for accurate time and country comparisons. |
| **National Health Accounts** | Crucial for **policy**, **planning**, and ensuring **transparency** in health spending. |

- **Health Financing Goals**: Achieve **risk protection**, **equity**, and **access** through effective systems.  
  The ultimate aim of health financing is to shield individuals from financial hardship (risk protection), ensure fair access regardless of income (equity), and make healthcare services available to all who need them (access). These goals align with **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)**, guiding the design of systems that prioritize people over profits. üõ°Ô∏èüåç  
- **Mechanisms**: **Revenue collection**, **fund pooling**, and **purchasing** are core components.  
  These three pillars form the backbone of any health financing system. Revenue collection gathers funds (e.g., taxes, premiums), fund pooling spreads financial risks across populations, and purchasing allocates funds to providers strategically or passively. Together, they ensure resources flow efficiently to deliver care. üí∏üîÑ  
- **Modalities**: Include **taxation**, **insurance**, **OOP payments**, **MSAs**, and **community financing**.  
  Countries mix these financing methods‚Äîtaxation for public funding, insurance (social or private) for risk pooling, out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for direct costs, Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) for individual savings, and community financing for local solutions. Each modality has unique strengths and challenges, shaping a country‚Äôs health system. üèõÔ∏èüí≥  
- **Comparisons**: Adjust expenditures using **PPP** and **inflation** for accurate time and country comparisons.  
  To compare health spending over time, **inflation** adjustments (e.g., using GDP deflators) account for price changes. For cross-country comparisons, **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)** reflects real purchasing power, ensuring fair assessments of investment levels. These tools are vital for meaningful data analysis. üìäüåê  
- **National Health Accounts**: Crucial for **policy**, **planning**, and ensuring **transparency** in health spending.  
  NHAs track expenditure flows, answering who pays, who receives, and what services are funded. They provide evidence for policymakers to optimize resource allocation, plan effectively, and maintain transparency, ensuring health systems are accountable and equitable. üìàü§ù  

| **Takeaway**                   | **Why It Matters**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Health Financing Goals         | Drives equitable, accessible systems aligned with UHC principles                  |
| Mechanisms                     | Forms the operational core of financing, ensuring funds reach providers           |
| Modalities                     | Offers diverse tools to balance equity, efficiency, and local needs               |
| Comparisons                    | Ensures accurate analysis of spending trends over time and across countries       |
| National Health Accounts       | Empowers evidence-based policy and transparency in resource use                   |

These takeaways encapsulate the lecture‚Äôs core messages, providing a **roadmap** for understanding health financing. They emphasize the need for systems that protect, equitably distribute resources, and are grounded in data-driven transparency‚Äîkey to building resilient health systems. üöÄ

## Calculation-based Questions

These questions assess **quantitative applications** of health financing concepts, particularly inflation adjustments and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). Use LaTeX for mathematical expressions where applicable. Show all workings.

1. **Inflation Adjustment for Malaysia‚Äôs THE**  
    Given Malaysia‚Äôs Total Health Expenditure (THE) of RM 10.2 billion in 2000 with a GDP deflator of 60.3, and RM 78.2 billion in 2021 with a GDP deflator of 111.4 (base year 2021), calculate the constant 2000 THE in 2021 terms. What is the real percentage increase from 2000 to 2021?
    
    - **Formula**: $$ \text{Constant THE} = \frac{\text{GDP Deflator}_{2021} \times \text{THE}_{\text{year}}}{\text{GDP Deflator}_{\text{year}}} $$
    - **Hint**: Use the lecture‚Äôs example for 1997: $$ \text{Constant 1997 THE} = \frac{111.4 \times 8.6}{52.1} = \text{RM 18.4 billion} $$.
2. **PPP Conversion for Health Expenditure**  
    In 2022, Malaysia‚Äôs per capita Current Health Expenditure (CHE) was RM 2,017, with an official exchange rate of RM 4.40 to USD 1.00 and a PPP exchange rate of RM 1.57 to USD 1.00. Calculate the per capita CHE in USD using both exchange rates. By what percentage is the Ringgit undervalued based on the PPP rate compared to the official rate?
    
    - **Formula**: $$\text{CHE in USD} = \frac{\text{CHE in RM}}{\text{Exchange Rate (RM per USD)}}$$$$\text{Undervaluation} = \frac{\text{PPP Rate} - \text{Official Rate}}{\text{PPP Rate}} \times 100\%$$
    - **Hint**: Refer to the lecture‚Äôs burger price example: $$\text{Undervalued by} = \frac{2.89 - 4.42}{2.89} \times 100\% = -53\%$$.
3. **Inflation Rate Calculation**  
    The price of a medical procedure in Malaysia was RM 500 in 2018 and RM 575 in 2023. Calculate the inflation rate over this period.
    
    - **Formula**:  $$\text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{\text{Price}_{2023} - \text{Price}_{2018}}{\text{Price}_{2018}} \times 100\%$$
    - **Hint**: Use the lecture‚Äôs burger price example: $$\text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{6.60 - 6.00}{6.00} \times 100\% = 10\%$$
    - **Solution**: $$\text{Inflation Rate} = \frac{575 - 500}{500} \times 100\% = \frac{75}{500} \times 100\% = 15\%$$.
4. **Progressivity Analysis**  
    Person A earns RM 2,000/month and pays RM 150 for healthcare. Person B earns RM 5,000/month and pays RM 250. Calculate the percentage of income spent on healthcare for each. Is this payment structure progressive, regressive, or proportional?
    
    - **Hint**: Refer to the lecture‚Äôs example: Mr. A (10% of income) vs. Mr. B (5% of income) is regressive.
