## 📝 Executive Summary

This lecture equips students with the tools to make **evidence-informed decisions** in resource-constrained health systems. It covers the **definition**, **types**, **economic principles**, **perspectives**, and **optimal timing** of economic evaluation, emphasizing its role in addressing **scarcity**, ensuring **efficiency**, and promoting **equity** and **transparency**. 

### 🌟 Overview and Importance

**Economic evaluation** is defined as a **comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences** (Drummond et al., 2005). It is a **central tool** in health economics, going beyond cost accounting to assess **value for money** for interventions like drugs, devices, programs, services, and policies. The lecture highlights the universal challenge of **scarcity**—**infinite health needs** versus **finite resources** (money, staff, time, infrastructure)—which forces health systems, including Malaysia’s, to make tough choices. Economic evaluation addresses this by enabling **rational**, **transparent**, and **efficient** resource allocation, supporting decisions at **national**, **state**, and **facility** levels. It ensures **transparency**, **accountability**, and **equity**, aligning with goals like **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)** and **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)**.

### 📋 Types of Economic Evaluation

The lecture introduces **four main types** of economic evaluation, each with distinct **outcome measures** and **decision focuses**:

|Type|Outcome Measure|Decision Focus|Key Limitation|
|---|---|---|---|
|**CMA (Cost-Minimization Analysis)**|Same outcome|Which is cheaper?|Rare in practice due to need for identical outcomes|
|**CEA (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis)**|Natural units (e.g., life years gained, cases detected)|Which gives more health for the cost?|Doesn’t value quality of life|
|**CUA (Cost-Utility Analysis)**|Utility-based (e.g., QALYs, DALYs)|Which gives more value considering quality of life?|Requires utility data|
|**CBA (Cost-Benefit Analysis)**|Monetary value (RM)|Do benefits exceed costs?|Ethically/methodologically controversial to monetize outcomes|

- **CMA**: Used when interventions have **identical outcomes**, focusing solely on cost differences (e.g., choosing between bioequivalent drugs).
- **CEA**: Measures outcomes in **natural units**, using the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**:  
    $$ICER = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta E} $$  
    where $\Delta C$ is the cost difference and $\Delta E$ is the effectiveness difference (e.g., RM50,000 per life year gained).
- **CUA**: Incorporates **quality of life** using **QALYs** (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) or **DALYs** (Disability-Adjusted Life Years), recommended for HTA (e.g., RM100,000/QALY).
- **CBA**: Converts outcomes to **monetary values**, enabling cross-sector comparisons but raising ethical challenges.

The lecture also distinguishes **partial evaluations** (single intervention analysis) from **full evaluations** (comparing multiple alternatives), emphasizing the latter’s robustness.

### 🧠 Key Economic Concepts

Four **core economic concepts** underpin economic evaluation:

- **Opportunity Cost**: The **value of the next best alternative forgone** (e.g., funding a cancer drug vs. ICU beds).
- **Scarcity**: **Limited resources** (money, staff, time) versus **unlimited health needs**, necessitating prioritization.
- **Efficiency**: Maximizing health benefits through **technical efficiency** (lowest cost for output, e.g., generic drugs) and **allocative efficiency** (maximizing population health, e.g., vaccinations).
- **Marginal Analysis**: Assessing **incremental costs and benefits** of small changes, using ICER to evaluate additional investments.

These concepts ensure **value-driven** decisions, focusing on health outcomes rather than just costs.

### 👀 Perspective in Evaluation

The **perspective** defines **whose costs and benefits** are included, shaping the evaluation’s scope:

|Perspective|Includes|Used By|
|---|---|---|
|**Societal**|All costs (direct, indirect, intangible)|Academics, global health|
|**Health System/Provider**|Medical costs only (e.g., hospital stays, drugs)|Ministries, hospitals|
|**Payer**|Costs to insurers/government schemes|Insurance companies, governments|
|**Patient**|Out-of-pocket and indirect costs|Equity studies, patient advocacy|

- **Societal**: Comprehensive, capturing **total societal impact** but data-intensive.
- **Health System**: Focuses on **medical costs**, suitable for budget planning (e.g., MaHTAS submissions).
- **Payer**: Includes **reimbursed costs**, relevant for programs like **MySalam**.
- **Patient**: Emphasizes **individual burdens**, critical for **equity** and **catastrophic health spending** analyses.

The choice of perspective can lead to **different conclusions** for the same intervention (e.g., a breast cancer therapy may be cost-effective societally but financially toxic for patients).

### ⏰ Timing of Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluation is most effective when **timely** and **purpose-driven**, aligned with **decision points** in planning or budgeting. It is valuable in:

- **Introducing new interventions** (e.g., new cancer therapy).
- **Scaling programs** (e.g., HPV vaccination expansion).
- **Choosing alternatives** (e.g., telehealth vs. outpatient visits).
- **Budget allocation** (e.g., dialysis vs. diabetes screening).
- **Addressing efficiency concerns** (e.g., re-evaluating screening guidelines).

Evaluations should be **avoided** when outcomes are **uncertain**, costs are **trivial**, or interventions are **not scalable**.

### 🧠 Key Terminologies Introduced

- **Economic Evaluation**: Comparative analysis of costs and consequences.
- **Value for Money**: Maximizing health benefits per unit of cost.
- **Scarcity**: Limited resources versus unlimited health needs.
- **Opportunity Cost**: Value of foregone alternatives.
- **Efficiency**: **Technical** (lowest cost for output) and **allocative** (maximizing population health).
- **Marginal Analysis**: Assessing incremental costs and benefits.
- **ICER**: Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio, measuring cost per additional outcome unit.
- **QALYs/DALYs**: Utility-based measures for quality and quantity of life.
- **Perspective**: Defines whose costs/benefits are included (societal, health system, payer, patient).
- **HTA**: Health Technology Assessment, evaluating interventions for adoption.
- **UHC**: Universal Health Coverage, ensuring equitable access to care.
- **Partial/Full Evaluation**: Single vs. comparative intervention analysis.

### 🌟 Conclusion

**Economic evaluation is not just about money—it’s about making wise decisions in the face of scarcity.** This lecture provides a robust framework for understanding and applying economic evaluation to **prioritize funding**, **improve equity**, and **maximize health gains**. By mastering its types, principles, perspectives, and timing, public health professionals can guide health systems toward **sustainable**, **transparent**, and **equitable** outcomes, aligning with Malaysia’s goals for **UHC** and effective **HTA**.

## 🏥 1. Introduction: The Challenge of Health Resource Allocation

The allocation of resources in healthcare is a complex and critical task, as health systems worldwide grapple with the tension between **infinite health needs** and **finite resources**. This section introduces the core challenge of health economics: making informed decisions about how to deploy limited resources to maximize health outcomes. By exploring the constraints of funding, the limitations of traditional decision-making, and the need for systematic approaches, we set the stage for understanding **economic evaluation** as a vital tool in health policy and practice.

### 💡 The Central Issue: Money and Medicine

> **"The only thing that a minister of health is ever destined to discuss with the medical profession is money."**  

This poignant statement captures the essence of health resource allocation: **money is at the heart of every healthcare decision**. Health ministers and policymakers are constantly navigating a landscape where financial constraints shape what can be achieved.

- **Ministries often face legitimate requests for additional funding**, each promising to improve health outcomes. For example, requests might include funding for new cancer treatments, expanded vaccination programs, or additional hospital beds. Each proposal is compelling, as it aims to enhance patient care or prevent disease.
- However, **resources**—including **money, people, time, facilities, and equipment**—are **limited** in all countries, regardless of their economic status. Even in wealthier nations, budgets are finite, and healthcare systems cannot fund every worthwhile initiative.
- As a result, **choices must be made** regarding the deployment of these scarce resources. Policymakers must decide which programs to prioritize, which to scale back, and which to reject outright. **There is never enough money to do everything worth doing**, making prioritization a universal challenge.

This reality underscores the need for a structured approach to decision-making, one that goes beyond subjective preferences and ensures resources are used efficiently and equitably.

### 🤔 Traditional Decision-Making: Gut Feelings

Historically, healthcare decisions have often relied on **gut feelings and educated guesses**, as noted in the lecture. While these approaches may be informed by experience, they lack the rigor needed for transparent and defensible resource allocation.

- **Gut feelings** involve intuitive judgments, often based on a policymaker’s or clinician’s sense of what seems right. For instance, a hospital administrator might prioritize a new surgical unit because it feels impactful, without quantifying its costs or benefits.
- **Educated guesses** incorporate some expertise or data but are still subjective. For example, a health official might estimate that a new screening program will save lives, but without systematic analysis, this remains speculative.
- Such approaches are insufficient because they **lack transparency** and **fail to compare alternatives systematically**. They cannot answer critical questions like: Is this intervention worth its cost? Could the same funds achieve more health gains elsewhere?

This reliance on intuition highlights the need for a more robust framework—one that provides evidence-based insights to guide resource allocation.

### ⚖️ The Need for Informed Choices

The lecture emphasizes that supporting one service or intervention often requires **cutting back on another**, creating a zero-sum scenario in resource-constrained environments. This trade-off demands a careful evaluation of costs, benefits, and priorities.

- **Stakeholders are reluctant to fund services without knowing their contents or specific costs**. For example, few would approve funding for a new medical device without understanding its purpose, effectiveness, or price. Similarly, patients and the public expect clarity on what they are paying for, whether through taxes or out-of-pocket expenses.
- **Giving support for one or several services/interventions means that something else should be cut back**. For instance, allocating funds to expand dialysis services might reduce the budget for preventive diabetes programs. These trade-offs are inevitable, and policymakers must weigh them carefully.
- **Policy makers need tools to make informed choices** about which requests to support. Without a systematic approach, decisions risk being arbitrary, inefficient, or inequitable. For example, how can a minister decide whether to fund a new cancer drug or a rural health clinic without clear evidence of their relative value?

**Economic evaluation** emerges as the solution to this challenge. By providing a comparative analysis of costs and consequences, it enables policymakers to make **evidence-informed decisions** that maximize health outcomes within budget constraints.

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

To equip you with the knowledge and skills to address these challenges, this session outlines clear learning outcomes. By the end of the lecture, you will be able to:

- **Define economic evaluation and its role in health decision-making**. You will understand how economic evaluation serves as a tool to assess the **value for money** of health interventions, ensuring resources are used efficiently.
- **Differentiate between types of economic evaluation**. You will learn to distinguish between methods like Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA), Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA), and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), each suited to different decision contexts.
- **Understand key economic concepts relevant to evaluation**. Concepts such as **opportunity cost**, **scarcity**, **efficiency**, and **marginal analysis** will provide the foundation for interpreting and conducting evaluations.
- **Recognize the importance of perspective in cost analysis**. You will explore how the choice of perspective (e.g., societal, health system, patient) shapes the costs and outcomes considered, influencing the conclusions of an evaluation.

These outcomes lay the groundwork for mastering economic evaluation, empowering you to contribute to **transparent, equitable, and efficient health systems** as public health professionals, researchers, or policymakers.

## 📊 2. What is Economic Evaluation?

Economic evaluation is a foundational concept in health economics, providing a structured framework to compare health interventions and guide resource allocation decisions. This section defines economic evaluation, outlines its key characteristics, and explains how it assesses both **costs** and **consequences** to determine **value for money**. By understanding its purpose and applications, you will appreciate how economic evaluation drives **efficient**, **transparent**, and **evidence-based** decision-making in healthcare.

### 🔍 Definition

> **Economic evaluation** is **"a comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences."**  
> — Drummond et al., 2005

This definition highlights the essence of economic evaluation: it is a **systematic comparison** that weighs both the **resources consumed** and the **health outcomes achieved** by different interventions. Unlike simple budgeting, which focuses solely on costs, economic evaluation emphasizes **value for money**, ensuring that health systems maximize benefits within constrained budgets.

- **Central tool in health economics**: Economic evaluation is a cornerstone methodology, widely used to inform policy and practice in healthcare.
- **Goes beyond simple cost accounting**: It moves past merely tallying expenses to assess whether the costs of an intervention are justified by its outcomes, focusing on **value for money**.
- **Applied to drugs, devices, programs, services, and policies**: Its versatility allows it to evaluate a wide range of health interventions, from new pharmaceuticals to public health campaigns and hospital services.

By providing a rigorous framework, economic evaluation helps policymakers answer critical questions about which interventions offer the greatest health benefits for the resources invested.

### ✨ Key Characteristics

Economic evaluation is distinguished by three core characteristics that ensure its robustness and applicability in health decision-making:

- **Comparative**: Economic evaluation **always compares at least two alternatives** to determine which offers better value. This comparative approach is essential for informed decision-making.
    
    - **Examples**:
        - Comparing a **new drug** to **standard care** to assess whether the new treatment is worth its cost.
        - Evaluating **hospital-based care** versus **home-based care** to determine the most cost-effective delivery model.
        - Analyzing a **preventive intervention** (e.g., a vaccination program) against **no intervention** to quantify its benefits.
    - This ensures that decisions are not made in isolation but are based on **relative performance** of options.
- **Dual-focused**: It examines both **costs** and **outcomes**, recognizing that neither alone is sufficient for decision-making.
    
    - Knowing **how much an intervention costs** is meaningless without understanding **what it achieves**.
    - Similarly, knowing **whether an intervention works** is incomplete without considering **its cost**.
    - By integrating both dimensions, economic evaluation provides a **holistic view** of an intervention’s value.
- **Systematic & Structured**: Economic evaluation uses **defined methods and models** to ensure consistency and reliability.
    
    - It follows **transparent** processes, allowing others to understand and verify the analysis.
    - It is **reproducible**, meaning that different analysts applying the same methods should reach similar conclusions.
    - This structured approach enhances **credibility** and supports **evidence-based policy**.

These characteristics make economic evaluation a powerful tool for navigating the complexities of healthcare resource allocation.

### 💰 Understanding Costs

**Costs** in economic evaluation refer to the **value of resources used** to implement an intervention. These resources are not limited to financial expenditures but encompass a broad range of inputs, each of which must be carefully considered.

- **Direct medical costs**: These are expenses directly related to healthcare delivery, such as:
    
    - **Hospital stays**: Costs of inpatient care, including bed occupancy and medical procedures.
    - **Medications**: Costs of drugs prescribed to patients.
    - **Staff time**: Salaries and wages for doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals involved in the intervention.
- **Direct non-medical costs**: These are non-healthcare-related expenses incurred as a result of the intervention, such as:
    
    - **Transport**: Costs for patients or families to travel to healthcare facilities.
    - **Caregiving**: Expenses for professional or informal caregivers supporting patients.
- **Indirect costs**: These reflect the broader economic impact of the intervention, such as:
    
    - **Productivity losses**: Lost income or work output due to illness, treatment, or recovery time. For example, a patient undergoing surgery may be unable to work, resulting in lost wages.
- **Intangible costs**: These are non-financial costs that are difficult to quantify, such as:
    
    - **Pain** or **anxiety** experienced by patients or their families.
    - These are **rarely monetized** due to measurement challenges but may still be considered in certain analyses.
- **Key requirement**: Costs must be **identified, measured, and valued** based on the **perspective** of the evaluation.
    
    - The **perspective** (e.g., societal, health system, patient) determines which costs are included. For instance, a societal perspective includes all costs, while a health system perspective focuses only on medical costs.
    - This ensures that the evaluation aligns with the decision-maker’s goals and context.

Understanding the full scope of costs is critical for accurately assessing an intervention’s resource requirements and ensuring fair comparisons.

### 📈 Understanding Consequences

**Consequences** refer to the **outcomes or effects** of an intervention, capturing the health benefits or changes it produces. These outcomes are the counterpart to costs, providing the "benefit" side of the value-for-money equation.

- **Clinical outcomes**: These are direct health effects, such as:
    
    - **Infections prevented**: For example, a vaccination program reducing the incidence of measles.
    - **Life years gained**: Extending patient survival through treatments like heart surgery.
- **Preference-weighted outcomes**: These account for both the quantity and quality of life, using metrics like:
    
    - **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**: A measure that combines life expectancy with quality of life, where 1 QALY represents one year in perfect health.
    - **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)**: A measure of disease burden, reflecting years lost due to disability or premature death.
- **Economic outcomes**: These are outcomes converted into monetary values, typically used in cost-benefit analysis.
    
    - For example, the monetary value of **productivity gains** from a workplace health program.
- **Requirements for outcomes**:
    
    - Outcomes must be **meaningful** to **patients** (e.g., improving quality of life) and **providers** (e.g., reducing hospital readmissions).
    - They must be **measurable** over a **relevant time horizon**, ensuring that short-term and long-term effects are captured accurately.

By quantifying consequences, economic evaluation ensures that the health benefits of interventions are clearly understood and comparable across alternatives.

### 🎯 Purpose of Economic Evaluation

The primary purpose of economic evaluation is to answer a critical question:

> **"Is the added benefit of this option worth the additional cost?"**

This question encapsulates the core goal of economic evaluation: to guide decision-makers in allocating scarce resources efficiently. By comparing the costs and consequences of different interventions, economic evaluation provides actionable insights for health policy and practice.

- **Supports efficient allocation of limited health resources**: In a world of finite budgets, economic evaluation helps prioritize interventions that deliver the greatest health benefits per unit of cost.
- **Helps decide whether to adopt, scale up, delay, or reject interventions**: Policymakers use economic evaluation to determine which interventions are worth implementing, expanding, postponing, or discontinuing.
- **Prioritizes interventions with high value for money**: By focusing on interventions that offer significant health gains relative to their costs, economic evaluation maximizes the impact of healthcare spending.

Economic evaluation thus serves as a bridge between clinical evidence and policy decisions, ensuring that resources are used to achieve the greatest possible health outcomes.

#### Example: Cost vs. Effectiveness

To illustrate how economic evaluation works in practice, consider the following comparison of two treatment options:

| Option            | Cost (RM) | Effectiveness (Life Years Gained) | Cost per Life Year          |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| A (Standard Care) | 10,000    | 3                                 | $\frac{10000}{3} = 3333.33$ |
| B (New Treatment) | 14,000    | 4                                 | $\frac{14000}{4} = 3500$    |

This table compares **Standard Care (Option A)** and a **New Treatment (Option B)** based on their costs and effectiveness, measured in **life years gained**. The **cost per life year** is calculated as:

**Decision-makers must consider**:

- **Is the extra RM4,000 for Option B justified by the additional year of life?**
    
    - Option B costs RM14,000 and yields 4 life years, compared to Option A’s RM10,000 and 3 life years. The additional cost of RM4,000 (14,000 - 10,000) delivers one extra life year (4 - 3).
    - The question is whether this incremental benefit (1 life year) is worth the incremental cost (RM4,000).
- **Would that RM4,000 yield more value if spent elsewhere?**
    
    - Policymakers must assess whether investing RM4,000 in another intervention (e.g., a preventive program or a different treatment) could produce greater health benefits than the additional life year gained from Option B.

This example demonstrates how economic evaluation quantifies trade-offs, enabling decision-makers to weigh costs against benefits and consider alternative uses of resources. The **cost per life year** metric provides a standardized way to compare interventions, supporting **informed** and **transparent** decisions.

## 🌍 3. Relevance to Health Systems

Economic evaluation is a vital tool for navigating the complexities of modern healthcare systems, where **limited resources** must meet **growing demands**. This section explores why economic evaluation is essential for health systems, particularly in Malaysia, by addressing the challenges of **scarcity**, ensuring **efficiency**, and aligning with broader health system goals. By providing **transparent** and **evidence-based** insights, economic evaluation supports **fair**, **accountable**, and **sustainable** decision-making across various levels of healthcare policy and practice.

### 🚨 Why Economic Evaluation Matters

Health systems operate under intense pressure to deliver high-quality care within constrained budgets. Economic evaluation is crucial because it provides a structured approach to making informed decisions in this resource-scarce environment.

- **Limited healthcare budgets cannot meet the rising demand for services**. As populations grow, age, and face new health challenges, the demand for healthcare services—such as advanced treatments, preventive programs, and infrastructure—continues to escalate, outpacing available funds.
- **Economic evaluation ensures**:
    - **Transparency in decision-making**: By clearly outlining the costs and benefits of interventions, it allows stakeholders to understand the rationale behind resource allocation choices.
    - **Accountability in spending**: It holds decision-makers accountable for using public funds responsibly, ensuring that every ringgit spent delivers measurable value.
    - **Fair and efficient use of public funds**: It promotes equitable distribution of resources and prioritizes interventions that maximize health outcomes for the population.
- **It is especially relevant for**:
    - **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)**: Evaluating new technologies, drugs, or procedures to determine their cost-effectiveness before adoption.
    - **National Formulary listing**: Deciding which medications to include in publicly funded drug lists, such as Malaysia’s MyHEALTH or MyHD lists.
    - **Universal Health Coverage (UHC) initiatives**: Supporting equitable access to essential health services, a key goal of UHC, by identifying interventions that offer the greatest value within budget constraints.

By addressing these critical areas, economic evaluation ensures that health systems operate with **clarity**, **responsibility**, and a focus on **maximizing health outcomes**.

### 🧠 Addressing the Fundamental Challenge

Health systems worldwide, including Malaysia’s, face a universal question:

> **How to deliver the best possible health outcomes with limited resources?**

This challenge is at the core of health economics, as resources—whether financial, human, or infrastructural—are always finite, while health needs are virtually limitless. Economic evaluation provides a practical framework to tackle this issue by offering evidence-based guidance for resource allocation.

- **Economic evaluation helps**:
    - **Prioritize funding**: It identifies which interventions deliver the greatest health benefits, enabling policymakers to allocate budgets to high-impact programs.
    - **Improve health equity**: By assessing the distributional impact of interventions, it ensures that resources reach underserved populations, reducing disparities in access to care.
    - **Maximize health gains**: It focuses on interventions that provide significant health benefits relative to their costs, optimizing the overall health of the population.
    - **Ensure transparency and accountability**: By using systematic and reproducible methods, economic evaluation builds trust in the decision-making process, showing stakeholders how and why choices are made.

In Malaysia, where the healthcare system balances public and private provision, economic evaluation is particularly valuable for aligning resources with national health priorities, such as improving access to care and addressing non-communicable diseases.

### ⚠️ The Problem of Scarcity

**Scarcity** is a universal constraint that shapes every healthcare decision:

- **Infinite health needs** vs. **finite resources** (budget, staff, infrastructure, time). The demand for healthcare—new treatments, preventive services, and facilities—far exceeds the available supply of resources, creating a constant need for prioritization.
- **Examples of tough choices**:
    - Should the health system **expand dialysis services** to support more patients with kidney failure, or **fund cancer screening** to detect and treat cancers early?
    - Is it better to **subsidize a new vaccine** to prevent infectious diseases, or **increase ICU beds** to manage critical care needs during emergencies?
- **Economic evaluation enables rational and transparent decision-making**. By quantifying the costs and benefits of each option, it provides a clear basis for choosing between competing priorities, ensuring that decisions are **evidence-based** and **justifiable** to stakeholders.

Scarcity forces health systems to make difficult trade-offs, but economic evaluation transforms these choices from subjective judgments into **systematic** and **defensible** decisions.

### 🗳️ Informing Policy and Decision-Making

Economic evaluation supports decisions at multiple levels of the health system, from national policies to facility-level choices, by providing **evidence** to justify decisions based on **value for money**.

|Level|Example Decision|
|---|---|
|**National**|Include a cancer drug in MyHEALTH or MyHD list?|
|**State**|Roll out mobile dental clinics or invest in fluoride varnish?|
|**Facility**|Choose between two new ventilator models?|

- **National level**: Economic evaluation informs decisions about including new drugs or technologies in national formularies, such as Malaysia’s MyHEALTH or MyHD lists, ensuring that only cost-effective options are adopted.
- **State level**: It guides regional health authorities in choosing between community-based interventions, like mobile dental clinics for rural areas, or preventive measures, like fluoride varnish to reduce dental caries.
- **Facility level**: Hospitals use economic evaluation to select equipment, such as choosing between ventilator models based on their cost-effectiveness and impact on patient outcomes.

By providing **quantitative evidence**, economic evaluation ensures that decisions at all levels are **aligned with the goal of maximizing health benefits** within available resources.

### 💸 Ensuring Value for Money (Efficiency)

Not all interventions offer equal value, and economic evaluation helps identify those that deliver the greatest health benefits for their cost.

|Intervention|Cost|Outcome|Cost-Effectiveness|
|---|---|---|---|
|Drug A|RM100,000|Extends life by 2 weeks|Low|
|Vaccine B|RM200|Prevents fatal illness|High|

- **Drug A**: At a cost of RM100,000, it extends life by only 2 weeks, resulting in **low cost-effectiveness**. The high cost for a minimal benefit suggests that this intervention may not be the best use of resources.
- **Vaccine B**: For just RM200, it prevents a fatal illness, offering **high cost-effectiveness**. This intervention delivers significant health benefits at a low cost, making it a priority for funding.
- **Economic evaluation helps avoid inefficient spending** by identifying interventions like Drug A that consume substantial resources for limited gains.
- It **redirects funds to high-impact interventions** like Vaccine B, which maximize health outcomes per ringgit spent.

This focus on **efficiency** ensures that health systems achieve the greatest possible impact with their limited budgets.

### 📰 Enhancing Transparency and Accountability

Transparent use of economic evaluation is essential for building trust and justifying health spending decisions:

- **Builds public trust in health spending**: By clearly explaining why certain interventions are funded, economic evaluation reassures the public that resources are used wisely.
- **Justifies why some treatments are funded and others are not**: For example, if a costly drug is excluded from the national formulary, economic evaluation provides evidence that its benefits do not justify its cost, making the decision defensible.
- **Supports evidence-informed policy**: It ensures that policies are grounded in data, reducing the risk of arbitrary or politically driven decisions.
- **Critical for public programs** like:
    - **Peka B40**: A Malaysian program providing healthcare for low-income groups, where economic evaluation ensures that funds are used effectively to benefit vulnerable populations.
    - **Vaccination Programme**: Economic evaluation supports decisions about which vaccines to include in national immunization efforts, maximizing public health impact.
    - **HTA reviews by MaHTAS**: Malaysia’s Health Technology Assessment body relies on economic evaluation to assess new technologies, ensuring that only cost-effective options are adopted.

By fostering **transparency** and **accountability**, economic evaluation strengthens public confidence in the healthcare system and supports **evidence-based governance**.

### 🌟 Alignment with Health System Goals

Economic evaluation contributes to the overarching goals of health systems, ensuring that resources are used to achieve **equity**, **efficiency**, and **sustainability**:

- **Equity**: Ensures **fair allocation of resources across population groups**. Economic evaluation helps identify interventions that benefit underserved or marginalized communities, reducing health disparities.
- **Efficiency**: Delivers **more health per ringgit spent**. By prioritizing cost-effective interventions, it maximizes the health benefits achieved within budget constraints.
- **Sustainability**: Helps maintain **long-term affordability of the health system**. By avoiding wasteful spending and focusing on high-value interventions, economic evaluation ensures that healthcare remains viable for future generations.

These contributions align with Malaysia’s health system priorities, such as achieving Universal Health Coverage and improving health outcomes for all citizens.

## 📋 4. Types of Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluation encompasses a variety of methods, each tailored to specific decision-making contexts in healthcare. This section explores the **four main types** of economic evaluation—Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA), Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA), and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)—detailing their **outcome measures**, **decision focuses**, and **applications**. Additionally, it distinguishes between **partial** and **full** economic evaluations, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to select the appropriate method based on the context and evidence available. By mastering these types, you will be equipped to choose the right evaluation approach to guide **efficient** and **evidence-based** health policy decisions.

### 🔄 Overview

There are **four main types** of economic evaluation, each differing in **how outcomes are measured** and **what decision they address**. These methods provide structured frameworks to compare health interventions, ensuring that resources are allocated to maximize health benefits.

|Type|Outcome Measure|Decision Focus|
|---|---|---|
|**CMA**|Same outcome|Which is cheaper?|
|**CEA**|Natural units (e.g., life years)|Which gives more health for the cost?|
|**CUA**|Utility-based (e.g., QALYs)|Which gives more value considering quality of life?|
|**CBA**|Money (RM)|Do the monetary benefits exceed the costs?|

This table summarizes the essence of each type, highlighting their unique approaches to measuring outcomes and guiding decisions. Each method is suited to specific scenarios, depending on the nature of the intervention and the decision-maker’s priorities.

### 1️⃣ Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)

**Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)** is used when the outcomes of two or more interventions are **proven to be identical**, making cost the sole differentiating factor.

- **Use When**:
    - Two or more interventions have **proven identical outcomes**, meaning their effectiveness is equivalent based on robust evidence.
    - The decision is **solely about cost differences**, focusing on identifying the cheapest option without compromising effectiveness.
- **Examples**:
    - Choosing between **two bioequivalent generic drugs** with different prices. For instance, if two generic versions of a medication have identical therapeutic effects, CMA compares their costs to select the more affordable one.
    - Selecting between **two labs** offering the same test accuracy. If two diagnostic labs provide identical results for a blood test, CMA determines which lab charges less.
- **Important**:
    - CMA is **rarely used** because it requires **strong evidence** that outcomes are truly equal. In practice, interventions often differ slightly in effectiveness, making other evaluation types more appropriate.

CMA is a straightforward method but limited in scope, as identical outcomes are uncommon in healthcare, necessitating careful validation before its application.

### 2️⃣ Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)

**Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)** evaluates interventions based on **natural units** of health outcomes, making it ideal for comparing interventions where quality of life is not the primary concern.

- **Outcome Measure**:
    - **Natural units**, such as:
        - **Life years gained**: Extending patient survival through treatments like heart failure drugs.
        - **Cases detected**: Identifying diseases through screening programs, such as breast cancer detection.
        - **Hospital admissions avoided**: Reducing hospitalizations through preventive measures, like vaccinations.
- **Examples**:
    - Comparing two cancer screening methods based on **cost per case detected**. For instance, evaluating mammography versus ultrasound for breast cancer screening to determine which detects more cases per unit of cost.
    - Assessing **cost per life year gained** from a new heart failure drug, comparing its cost and survival benefits to standard treatment.
- **Output**:
    - **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, which measures the additional cost per unit of additional effectiveness:  
        $$ICER = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta E}$$  
        where (\Delta C) is the difference in costs, and (\Delta E) is the difference in effectiveness.
        - Example: An ICER of RM50,000 per life year gained indicates that each additional year of life costs RM50,000 compared to the alternative.
- **Used When**:
    - The outcome is important but does not need to capture **quality of life**. CEA is suitable for clinical outcomes like survival or disease detection, where well-being is not the primary focus.

CEA is widely used in healthcare for its simplicity and focus on measurable health outcomes, but it does not account for the qualitative aspects of health, such as patient comfort or disability.

### 3️⃣ Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)

**Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)** incorporates both the **quantity** and **quality** of life, using utility-based measures to assess interventions where well-being is a critical factor.

- **Outcome Measure**:
    - **Utility-based measures**, such as:
        - **QALYs** (Quality-Adjusted Life Years): A metric combining life expectancy with quality of life, where 1 QALY represents one year in perfect health.
        - **DALYs** (Disability-Adjusted Life Years): A measure of disease burden, reflecting years lost due to disability or premature death.
    - Captures both **quantity** (length of life) and **quality** (well-being), providing a comprehensive view of health outcomes.
- **Examples**:
    - Evaluating a cancer treatment that prolongs life but has **toxic side effects**. CUA assesses whether the extended survival justifies the reduced quality of life due to side effects.
    - Comparing **surgery vs. physiotherapy** in elderly patients, weighing the benefits of improved mobility against surgical risks and recovery time.
- **Output**:
    - **Cost per QALY gained** (e.g., RM100,000/QALY), indicating the cost of achieving one additional year of perfect health.
- **Key Note**:
    - **CUA is the most commonly recommended method for Health Technology Assessment (HTA)** because it accounts for both survival and quality of life, making it versatile for evaluating complex interventions.

CUA’s ability to integrate quality of life makes it a preferred choice for HTA bodies like Malaysia’s MaHTAS, but it requires robust data on patient preferences and health states.

### 4️⃣ Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)

**Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)** converts all outcomes into **monetary values**, allowing comparisons across health and non-health sectors.

- **Outcome Measure**:
    - All outcomes are **converted into monetary value** (RM), such as the financial value of health improvements or productivity gains.
- **Key Question**:
    
    > **"Do the benefits (in RM) outweigh the costs?"**
    
    - CBA seeks to determine whether the monetary benefits of an intervention exceed its costs, providing a clear financial perspective.
- **Examples**:
    - Evaluating a workplace health program based on **saved productivity**. For instance, a program reducing employee sick days may generate monetary benefits through increased work output.
    - Assessing safety interventions in monetary terms, such as the **RM value of life saved** in road safety campaigns.
- **Advantages**:
    - Allows comparison across **non-health sectors**, such as education or transportation, by expressing all outcomes in a common monetary unit.
- **Challenges**:
    - **Monetizing life, pain, or suffering is ethically and methodologically controversial**. Assigning a monetary value to human life or emotional distress can be contentious and difficult to quantify accurately.

CBA’s strength lies in its broad applicability, but its reliance on monetization limits its use in health contexts where ethical considerations are paramount.

### 📊 Summary Table: Types of Economic Evaluation

The following table consolidates the key features and limitations of each evaluation type, providing a quick reference for decision-makers:

|Type|Outcome|Example|Key Limitation|
|---|---|---|---|
|**CMA**|Same outcomes|Two bioequivalent drugs|Rare in practice|
|**CEA**|Natural units|Cost per case prevented|Doesn’t value quality of life|
|**CUA**|QALYs/DALYs|Cancer treatment analysis|Utility data needed|
|**CBA**|RM|Workplace wellness ROI|Hard to monetize outcomes|

This table highlights the trade-offs between methods, emphasizing the need to match the evaluation type to the decision context and available data.

### 🧩 Choosing the Right Evaluation Type

Selecting the appropriate type of economic evaluation is critical for ensuring that the analysis addresses the decision-maker’s needs:

- The **context** and **decision needs** determine the best approach. For example, a hospital choosing between identical diagnostic tests may use CMA, while a national HTA body evaluating a new drug may prefer CUA.
- **Key question**: **Is there evidence on the effectiveness of interventions?**
    - If **no**, economic evaluation may not be feasible, as reliable data on outcomes are essential for meaningful analysis.
    - If **yes**, select the type based on the **outcome measure** (e.g., natural units for CEA, QALYs for CUA) and **decision focus** (e.g., cost savings for CMA, monetary benefits for CBA).

This decision-making process ensures that the evaluation is **relevant**, **feasible**, and **aligned** with the goals of the analysis.

### 🔍 Partial vs. Full Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluations can be classified as **partial** or **full**, depending on whether they include a comparator scenario:

- **Partial Evaluation**:
    - A **cost-outcome study** that evaluates **a single course of action** without a comparator.
    - **Example**: Assessing the costs and outcomes of a single policy option, such as a new public health campaign, without comparing it to an alternative.
    - Partial evaluations are limited because they do not provide a relative assessment of value, making them less robust for decision-making.
- **Full Economic Evaluation**:
    - **Explicitly compares** the costs and consequences of **two or more alternatives**, providing a more comprehensive analysis.
    - **Example**: Comparing a new treatment to standard care to determine which offers better value for money.
    - Full evaluations are preferred in health economics because they enable decision-makers to weigh trade-offs between options.

The difference between full economic evaluations and cost-outcome partial evaluations lies in the presence of a comparator scenario. Full evaluations include at least one alternative, allowing for a direct comparison of costs and consequences, while partial evaluations focus on a single intervention in isolation.

This distinction underscores the importance of comparators in ensuring that economic evaluations provide actionable insights for resource allocation.

## 💡 5. Key Economic Concepts

Economic evaluations in healthcare are grounded in fundamental economic principles that shape how resources are allocated and decisions are made. This section explores four critical concepts—**Opportunity Cost**, **Scarcity**, **Efficiency**, and **Marginal Analysis**—which are essential for conducting and interpreting economic evaluations. By understanding these principles, you will be equipped to make **value-based** decisions that maximize health outcomes within the constraints of limited resources, ensuring that healthcare systems operate **efficiently** and **equitably**.

### 🌟 Why Economic Concepts Matter

Before conducting or interpreting any economic evaluation, it’s **crucial** to understand the economic principles underpinning health decisions. These principles provide the theoretical foundation for evaluating interventions and prioritizing resources in a way that aligns with the goals of health systems.

- **Opportunity Cost**: Highlights the trade-offs inherent in every decision, ensuring that the value of foregone alternatives is considered.
- **Scarcity**: Explains why prioritization is necessary, given the mismatch between limited resources and unlimited health needs.
- **Efficiency**: Guides the allocation of resources to achieve the maximum possible health benefits.
- **Marginal Analysis**: Enables fine-tuned decisions by examining the incremental costs and benefits of small changes in resource allocation.

**These concepts ensure decisions are value-based, not just cost-based**, moving beyond simple budgeting to focus on the **health outcomes** achieved per unit of cost. By anchoring economic evaluations in these principles, decision-makers can make **informed**, **transparent**, and **defensible** choices that optimize resource use.

### 1️⃣ Opportunity Cost

**Definition**:

- **The value of the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made**. Opportunity cost represents what is sacrificed when one option is chosen over another, emphasizing the trade-offs inherent in resource allocation.

**In Healthcare**:

- **Funding a cancer screening program may mean not funding additional ICU beds**. For example, allocating resources to screen for breast cancer might reduce the budget available to expand critical care capacity, impacting patients needing intensive care.
- **Spending RM1 million on Drug A means forgoing what could have been achieved with that RM1 million elsewhere**. If RM1 million is spent on an expensive medication, the opportunity cost could be the inability to fund a vaccination program that might prevent thousands of infections.

**Takeaway**:

- **Every decision involves a trade-off**. Recognizing opportunity costs ensures that decision-makers weigh the benefits of the chosen intervention against the potential benefits of alternatives, promoting **efficient** and **strategic** resource use.

Opportunity cost is a cornerstone of economic thinking, reminding us that resources are finite and every choice has consequences for what is left undone.

### 2️⃣ Scarcity

**Definition**:

- **Resources (money, staff, time, technology) are limited, but health needs are unlimited**. Scarcity is the fundamental economic problem, where the demand for healthcare far exceeds the supply of resources available to meet it.

**In Real Terms**:

- **There are not enough doctors, nurses, or funds to do everything**. For instance, a hospital may lack the staff to provide specialized care to all patients, or a health ministry may lack the budget to fund every proposed intervention.
- **Not every patient can receive every possible treatment**. Due to resource constraints, some patients may face delays in care, or certain treatments may not be available in public facilities.

**Implication**:

- **Scarcity forces choices**, and **economic evaluation helps guide them**. By providing a systematic way to compare the costs and benefits of different interventions, economic evaluation ensures that limited resources are allocated to the most impactful options, addressing the most pressing health needs.

Scarcity underscores the need for prioritization in healthcare, making economic evaluation an indispensable tool for navigating these constraints.

### 3️⃣ Efficiency in Healthcare

**Definition**:

- **Achieving the maximum benefit from available resources**. Efficiency is about getting the most health outcomes—such as lives saved, diseases prevented, or quality of life improved—for the resources invested.

**Two Main Types**:

1. **Technical Efficiency**:
    - **Producing a given output at the lowest cost**. This involves delivering a specific health service or outcome as economically as possible without compromising quality.
    - **Example**: Using **generic drugs** instead of branded ones. Generic drugs provide the same therapeutic benefits at a lower cost, freeing up resources for other priorities.
2. **Allocative Efficiency**:
    - **Allocating resources to maximize overall population health**. This involves choosing interventions that benefit the largest number of people or address the most significant health challenges.
    - **Example**: Investing in **vaccinations** vs. rare-disease treatments. Vaccinations may prevent widespread illness across a population, while rare-disease treatments benefit a smaller group, making the former more allocatively efficient in many contexts.

**Outcome**:

- **Efficient choices lead to more health gains per RM spent**. By optimizing resource use, efficiency ensures that health systems deliver greater value, improving access to care and health outcomes within budget constraints.

Efficiency is a guiding principle in health economics, ensuring that every ringgit spent contributes to the greatest possible health impact.

### 4️⃣ Marginal Analysis

**Definition**:

- **Examines the additional (marginal) cost and benefit of increasing or decreasing an activity by a small amount**. Marginal analysis focuses on the incremental effects of small changes, helping decision-makers fine-tune resource allocation.

**In Practice**:

- **What is the extra cost of screening 1,000 more people?** For example, extending a cancer screening program to an additional 1,000 individuals may require additional staff, equipment, and facilities, increasing costs.
- **Does the additional benefit justify the added cost?** If screening 1,000 more people detects only a few additional cases, the benefit may not outweigh the cost, suggesting that resources might be better used elsewhere.

**Key Tool**:

- **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**:  
    $$ ICER = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta E} $$
    - Measures **how much extra is paid for each additional unit of outcome**, where $\Delta C$ is the difference in costs, and $\Delta E$ is the difference in effectiveness.
    - For example, if a new treatment costs an additional RM50,000 and provides one extra year of life compared to standard care, the ICER is RM50,000 per life year gained.

Marginal analysis allows decision-makers to assess whether small increases in investment are worthwhile, ensuring that resources are allocated where they generate the most value.

### 📊 Recap: Why These Concepts Matter

The following table summarizes the practical importance of each economic concept, highlighting their role in shaping value-driven decisions:

|Concept|Practical Importance|
|---|---|
|**Opportunity Cost**|Recognizes trade-offs in decisions|
|**Scarcity**|Explains why prioritization is needed|
|**Efficiency**|Promotes maximum value from resources|
|**Marginal Analysis**|Helps fine-tune decision thresholds|

**These concepts underpin every economic evaluation model**, ensuring that decisions are **value-driven** rather than solely cost-driven. By integrating opportunity cost, scarcity, efficiency, and marginal analysis, economic evaluations provide a robust framework for prioritizing interventions that deliver the greatest health benefits within limited budgets.

## 👀 6. Perspective in Economic Evaluation

The **perspective** of an economic evaluation is a critical factor that shapes the scope and conclusions of the analysis. By defining **whose costs and benefits** are considered, the perspective determines which aspects of an intervention are evaluated and how the results are interpreted. This section explores the concept of perspective, details the **common perspectives** used in health economics, and illustrates how the choice of perspective can lead to different conclusions for the same intervention. Understanding perspective is essential for ensuring that economic evaluations are **aligned with the decision-making context** and produce **relevant** and **actionable** insights.

### 🔍 What is Perspective?

**Definition**:

- The **perspective** of an economic evaluation defines **whose costs and benefits** are included in the analysis. It establishes the lens through which the intervention’s impact is assessed, focusing on specific stakeholders or the broader society.

**It guides**:

- **What types of costs to include**: For example, whether to consider only medical costs or also non-medical costs like transportation.
- **Whose outcomes matter**: Whether the focus is on patient health, societal benefits, or payer savings.
- **How broad or narrow the evaluation is**: A societal perspective is comprehensive, while a health system perspective is more focused.

**Importance**:

- **Choosing the right perspective is critical**, as it **directly affects the conclusions** of the study. An inappropriate perspective can lead to misleading results, misguiding policy or resource allocation decisions.

The perspective serves as the foundation for structuring an economic evaluation, ensuring that the analysis is tailored to the needs of the decision-maker and the context of the decision.

### 🌐 Common Perspectives

Economic evaluations adopt different perspectives based on the stakeholders involved and the goals of the analysis. The following table summarizes the **four common perspectives**, their scope, and their typical users:

|Perspective|Includes|Often Used By|
|---|---|---|
|**Societal**|All costs and benefits (direct, indirect, intangible)|Academics, global health|
|**Health System / Provider**|Medical costs only (e.g., drugs, hospital stays)|Ministries of Health, public hospitals|
|**Payer**|Costs borne by insurer or funding agency|Insurance companies, governments|
|**Patient**|Out-of-pocket and indirect costs to the individual|Patient advocacy, equity studies|

Each perspective focuses on different costs and outcomes, making it essential to select the one that aligns with the evaluation’s purpose and audience.

#### 1️⃣ Societal Perspective

- **Most comprehensive perspective**, capturing the broadest range of costs and benefits across all stakeholders.
- **Includes**:
    - **Medical costs**: Expenses for treatments, hospitalizations, and medications.
    - **Non-medical costs**: Costs like transportation to healthcare facilities.
    - **Productivity losses**: Lost income due to illness or treatment-related absences.
    - **Informal caregiving**: Time and resources spent by family or friends providing care.
    - **Intangible costs**: Non-monetary costs like pain or suffering, though these are rarely monetized.
- **Pros**:
    - **Captures the total impact on society**, providing a holistic view of an intervention’s effects.
    - **Best for macro-level policy decisions**, such as national health strategies or global health initiatives.
- **Cons**:
    - **Data-intensive**, requiring extensive data collection across multiple sectors.
    - **Not always feasible in local or budget-specific contexts**, where data or resources may be limited.
- **Recommended by**: **WHO**, **OECD**, and for **cost-utility analyses** (e.g., those using QALYs), due to its comprehensive scope.

The societal perspective is ideal for broad policy questions but can be challenging to implement due to its complexity and data requirements.

#### 2️⃣ Health System / Provider Perspective

- **Focuses only on costs to the public health system or provider**, narrowing the scope to direct healthcare expenditures.
- **Includes**:
    - **Hospital stays**: Costs of inpatient care and facilities.
    - **Medications**: Costs of drugs provided by the health system.
    - **Staff time**: Salaries for healthcare professionals involved in the intervention.
    - **Equipment**: Costs of medical devices or infrastructure.
- **Excludes**:
    - **Patient out-of-pocket costs**: Expenses borne by individuals, such as co-payments.
    - **Lost productivity**: Economic impacts outside the health system, like missed work.
- **Suitable for**:
    - **Government budget planning**, where the focus is on managing public healthcare budgets.
    - **Evaluations submitted to HTA bodies** like **MaHTAS (Malaysia)**, which assess interventions for inclusion in public health systems.

This perspective is practical for health ministries and hospitals focused on optimizing their budgets but may overlook broader societal impacts.

#### 3️⃣ Payer Perspective

- **Focuses on costs to the third-party payer**, such as insurance companies, employer health plans, or government schemes.
- **Includes**:
    - **Reimbursed medical expenses**: Costs covered by the payer, such as hospital bills or drug reimbursements.
    - **Claims paid out**: Payments made to healthcare providers or patients under insurance plans.
- **Relevant in**:
    - Contexts where services are **insured or subsidized**, such as Malaysia’s **MySalam** program or private insurance plans.
- **Limitation**:
    - **May ignore downstream societal costs or patient burdens**, such as productivity losses or out-of-pocket expenses not covered by insurance.

The payer perspective is critical for entities managing insurance or reimbursement schemes but may not capture the full economic impact of an intervention.

#### 4️⃣ Patient Perspective

- **Focuses on the individual receiving care**, emphasizing the financial and personal burden on patients.
- **Includes**:
    - **Out-of-pocket medical expenses**: Costs paid directly by patients, such as co-pays or uncovered treatments.
    - **Travel, food, lodging costs**: Expenses incurred to access healthcare, such as transportation to clinics.
    - **Income loss due to illness or caregiving**: Lost wages from taking time off work for treatment or to care for a loved one.
- **Important for**:
    - **Equity analyses**: Assessing whether interventions disproportionately burden certain groups.
    - **Evaluating financial hardship and catastrophic health spending**: Identifying interventions that push patients into financial distress.
- **Used in**:
    - **Studies on cancer care affordability in Malaysia**, where high out-of-pocket costs can create significant barriers to access.

The patient perspective highlights the individual’s experience, making it essential for understanding equity and affordability issues.

### 🧠 Why Perspective Matters: Example

**Scenario**: Breast cancer treatment with a new targeted therapy.

The choice of perspective can lead to vastly different conclusions about the same intervention, as shown in the following table:

|Perspective|Evaluation Result|
|---|---|
|**Societal**|High cost, but offset by patient survival, return to work, reduced caregiver burden = **Cost-effective**|
|**Health System**|Expensive, limited budget impact benefit = **Not cost-effective**|
|**Patient**|High out-of-pocket cost despite subsidies = **Financially toxic**|

**Key Insight**:

- **The same intervention can yield different conclusions depending on the perspective**.
    - From a **societal perspective**, the treatment is cost-effective because it accounts for benefits like improved survival and productivity, which offset the high costs.
    - From a **health system perspective**, the treatment appears not cost-effective due to its high cost and limited budget impact within the healthcare system.
    - From a **patient perspective**, the treatment is financially toxic, as out-of-pocket costs create significant financial hardship despite subsidies.

This example illustrates how perspective shapes the evaluation’s focus and outcomes, highlighting the need to choose the perspective carefully based on the decision context.

### 📝 Summary: Perspective in Evaluation

**Perspective determines**:

- **What costs and outcomes are included**: For example, a societal perspective includes all costs, while a patient perspective focuses on individual expenses.
- **Who benefits or pays**: Whether the focus is on society, the health system, payers, or patients.
- **What decision is being supported**: The perspective aligns the evaluation with the specific policy or resource allocation question.

**Best Practice**:

- **Always align the perspective with**:
    - **The policy question**: What decision is the evaluation intended to inform?
    - **The target audience**: Who will use the results (e.g., policymakers, insurers, patients)?
    - **The data availability**: What data are feasible to collect for the analysis?

By aligning the perspective with these factors, economic evaluations produce **relevant**, **accurate**, and **decision-focused** results that guide effective resource allocation.

## ⏰ 7. Timing of Economic Evaluation

The timing of an economic evaluation is a critical factor in its effectiveness, as it determines whether the analysis can meaningfully inform resource allocation decisions. This section explores why **timing matters**, identifies **key situations** where economic evaluation is most valuable, and highlights scenarios where it may be less useful. By aligning evaluations with **decision-making needs** and ensuring the availability of **high-quality data**, economic evaluations can provide **timely**, **relevant**, and **actionable** insights to optimize healthcare resource use.

### 🕒 Why Timing Matters

Economic evaluation is not a one-size-fits-all exercise; it must be **purpose-driven** and **timely** to maximize its impact.

- **Economic evaluation should be purpose-driven and timely**. The value of an evaluation lies in its ability to provide actionable evidence when decisions are being made, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently and effectively.
- **The right time to conduct an evaluation is when a decision needs to be made about allocating limited resources**. For example, an evaluation is most useful when policymakers are deciding whether to fund a new intervention or reallocate existing budgets.
- **Timing and context determine the evaluation’s usefulness**. An evaluation conducted too early (before sufficient data are available) or too late (after decisions are finalized) may fail to influence policy or practice. The context—such as budget cycles, policy windows, or emerging health challenges—shapes the relevance of the analysis.

By aligning economic evaluations with critical decision points, health systems can ensure that the results are both **relevant** and **impactful**, guiding resource allocation in a way that maximizes health outcomes.

### 📋 Situations That Call for Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluation is particularly valuable in specific scenarios where resource allocation decisions require evidence-based insights. The following situations highlight when economic evaluation is most needed:

1. **Introduction of New Health Interventions**
    
    - **Involves new drugs, vaccines, diagnostic tests, or surgical procedures**. These innovations often come with high costs and uncertain benefits, necessitating careful evaluation.
    - **Question**: **Is this intervention worth adopting given its cost and benefit?** Decision-makers need to determine whether the health benefits justify the investment.
    - **Example**: **Introducing a new breast cancer therapy under the national formulary**. An economic evaluation can assess whether the therapy’s benefits (e.g., improved survival) outweigh its costs compared to existing treatments.
2. **Scaling Up Existing Interventions**
    
    - **Expanding successful pilot programs to a national or state level**. Pilot programs may show promise in small-scale trials, but their cost-effectiveness at a larger scale must be confirmed.
    - **Question**: **Is the intervention still cost-effective at a larger scale?** Scaling up may involve higher costs or different outcomes, requiring re-evaluation.
    - **Example**: **Extending the HPV vaccination program to older age groups**. An evaluation can determine whether expanding the program to include additional populations remains cost-effective.
3. **Choosing Between Alternatives**
    
    - **Comparing two or more options that deliver similar services**. When multiple interventions achieve similar goals, economic evaluation identifies the most cost-effective option.
    - **Question**: **Which one offers more value for money?** The focus is on maximizing health benefits within budget constraints.
    - **Example**: **Comparing telehealth consultations vs. physical outpatient visits for chronic disease follow-up**. An evaluation can assess which delivery method provides better outcomes at a lower cost.
4. **Budget Allocation and Priority Setting**
    
    - **When multiple programs compete for the same funds**. Health systems often face competing demands, requiring prioritization to allocate limited resources effectively.
    - **Question**: **Which programs should be funded, expanded, or defunded?** Economic evaluation provides evidence to guide these tough choices.
    - **Example**: **Deciding between expanding dialysis services or preventive diabetes screening in rural areas**. An evaluation can compare the health impact and costs of each option to inform budget decisions.
5. **Addressing Concerns About Efficiency**
    
    - **When an existing intervention is suspected to be inefficient or outdated**. Programs that consume significant resources without delivering proportional benefits need re-assessment.
    - **Question**: **Are we spending too much for too little benefit?** Economic evaluation identifies opportunities to redirect resources to more effective interventions.
    - **Example**: **Re-evaluating national health screening guidelines that yield low detection rates**. An evaluation can determine whether the screening program justifies its costs or if resources should be reallocated.

These situations highlight the diverse applications of economic evaluation, from adopting new technologies to optimizing existing programs, ensuring that decisions are **evidence-based** and **aligned with health system goals**.

### 🚫 When Evaluation May Be Less Useful

While economic evaluation is a powerful tool, there are scenarios where it may not provide meaningful insights, and conducting an evaluation could be a poor use of resources.

- **Avoid conducting economic evaluation when**:
    - **Outcomes or effectiveness are unknown or highly uncertain**. Without reliable data on an intervention’s impact, economic evaluation cannot produce valid results. For example, a new drug with no clinical trial data cannot be meaningfully evaluated.
    - **Costs are trivial and unlikely to influence decisions**. If an intervention’s costs are negligible (e.g., a low-cost health education pamphlet), an evaluation may not be worth the effort.
    - **The intervention is not scalable or politically feasible**. If an intervention cannot be implemented widely due to logistical or political barriers, an evaluation may have little practical value.
- **Important**:
    - **Economic evaluation works best with high-quality effectiveness data**. Robust clinical or real-world evidence is essential for accurate cost-effectiveness estimates, ensuring that the evaluation is credible and useful.

Recognizing when economic evaluation is inappropriate helps decision-makers avoid wasting resources on analyses that cannot inform policy or practice.

### 📝 Summary: When to Conduct an Economic Evaluation

To maximize the impact of economic evaluation, it should be conducted in situations where it can directly inform resource allocation decisions:

- **Conduct an evaluation when**:
    - **A new resource allocation decision is needed**. For example, when deciding whether to fund a new treatment or program.
    - **There are competing interventions**. When multiple options vie for the same resources, evaluation identifies the most cost-effective choice.
    - **The goal is to maximize health benefit within budget constraints**. Evaluation ensures that limited funds are used to achieve the greatest possible health outcomes.
    - **Evidence will inform policy, procurement, or program expansion**. Evaluations are most valuable when their results can guide tangible actions, such as adopting a new drug or scaling up a public health program.
- **Tip**:
    - **Align the timing of evaluation with key decision points in planning or budgeting cycles**. For instance, conducting an evaluation during the annual budget planning process ensures that results are available when funding decisions are made.

By timing evaluations strategically, health systems can ensure that they are **relevant**, **timely**, and **impactful**, directly supporting **evidence-informed decision-making**.

### 1️⃣ Key Takeaway: What is Economic Evaluation?

Economic evaluation is a cornerstone of health economics, providing a structured framework to assess the value of health interventions.

- **A comparative analysis of two or more interventions**: It always involves comparing at least two options, such as a new drug versus standard care, to determine which offers better value.
- **Examines both costs and consequences**: It considers both the resources consumed (e.g., financial costs, staff time) and the outcomes achieved (e.g., lives saved, quality of life improved).
- **Determines value for money in healthcare**: By quantifying costs and benefits, it helps identify interventions that deliver the greatest health impact per unit of cost.
- **Supports smart decisions in policy, budgeting, and clinical practice**: Economic evaluation informs decisions at national, state, and facility levels, ensuring resources are used efficiently and effectively.

This takeaway emphasizes that economic evaluation is not just about cost but about **balancing costs with health outcomes** to make informed choices.

### 2️⃣ Key Takeaway: Types of Economic Evaluation

The lecture outlined **four main types** of economic evaluation, each with a unique approach to measuring outcomes and addressing decision-making needs. The following table summarizes their key features:

|Type|Key Feature|Outcome Unit|
|---|---|---|
|**CMA**|Cost only|Same outcome|
|**CEA**|Cost per natural unit|Life years, cases detected|
|**CUA**|Cost per utility unit|QALYs, DALYs|
|**CBA**|Cost vs. benefit|Both in monetary value|

- **CMA (Cost-Minimization Analysis)**: Focuses on cost differences when outcomes are identical, e.g., choosing between two bioequivalent drugs.
- **CEA (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis)**: Measures outcomes in natural units (e.g., life years gained), suitable for clinical outcomes like disease detection.
- **CUA (Cost-Utility Analysis)**: Uses utility-based measures like QALYs or DALYs to capture both quantity and quality of life, ideal for Health Technology Assessments.
- **CBA (Cost-Benefit Analysis)**: Converts all outcomes to monetary values, allowing comparisons across sectors but raising ethical challenges in monetizing health.

This diversity ensures that economic evaluation can be tailored to specific contexts, from clinical decisions to cross-sector policy comparisons.

### 3️⃣ Key Takeaway: Economic Principles Matter

Understanding **core economic concepts** is essential for conducting and interpreting economic evaluations. These principles shape how resources are prioritized and allocated in healthcare.

- **Opportunity Cost**: **All choices involve trade-offs**. Choosing one intervention (e.g., funding a new drug) means forgoing another (e.g., expanding hospital beds), and decision-makers must weigh these trade-offs.
- **Scarcity**: **Not all needs can be met** due to limited resources (e.g., budget, staff, time), necessitating prioritization.
- **Efficiency**: The goal is to **get the most health for each Ringgit**, achieving maximum benefits through technical (lowest cost for output) and allocative (maximizing population health) efficiency.
- **Marginal Analysis**: Focuses on **incremental cost and benefit**, using metrics like the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) to assess whether additional investments are worthwhile.

**These concepts shape prioritization and resource allocation**, ensuring that decisions are **value-driven** rather than solely cost-driven, aligning with the goal of maximizing health outcomes.

### 4️⃣ Key Takeaway: Perspective Shapes Evaluation

The **perspective** of an economic evaluation—whether societal, health system, payer, or patient—determines the scope and focus of the analysis.

- **Which costs and benefits are included**: A societal perspective includes all costs (e.g., medical, non-medical, productivity losses), while a patient perspective focuses on out-of-pocket expenses.
- **How broadly the impact is measured**: A societal perspective captures the total societal impact, while a health system perspective is narrower, focusing only on medical costs.
- **Who the results are relevant to**: Different stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, insurers, patients) require different perspectives to address their specific needs.

**Best Practice**:

- **Align the perspective with the decision-maker’s goals**. For example, use a health system perspective for government budget planning or a patient perspective for equity studies to ensure relevance and applicability.

This takeaway underscores the importance of selecting the appropriate perspective to produce **relevant** and **actionable** evaluation results.

### 5️⃣ Key Takeaway: When to Use Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluation is most valuable in specific scenarios where it can inform resource allocation decisions, but it should be avoided in situations where it offers little value.

- **Conduct evaluation when**:
    - **Introducing new interventions**: Assessing whether new drugs, vaccines, or procedures are worth adopting (e.g., a new cancer therapy).
    - **Scaling or revising programs**: Evaluating whether expanding existing programs, like HPV vaccination, remains cost-effective.
    - **Facing budget or resource trade-offs**: Choosing between competing priorities, such as dialysis services versus diabetes screening.
    - **Making policy or reimbursement decisions**: Informing decisions about formulary listings or insurance coverage.
- **Avoid when**:
    - **Outcomes are uncertain**, as evaluations require reliable effectiveness data to be meaningful.
    - **The decision won’t change**, such as when costs are trivial or political factors override economic evidence.

This takeaway highlights the importance of **strategic timing** to ensure that evaluations are **relevant** and **impactful**.

### 🧠 Final Reflection

> **"Economic evaluation is not just about money—it’s about making wise decisions in the face of scarcity."**

This powerful statement encapsulates the essence of economic evaluation: it is a tool for navigating the constraints of limited resources to achieve the greatest possible health benefits. **As public health professionals, researchers, or policymakers**, your role is to use these tools to guide health systems toward **better outcomes for all**, ensuring **equity**, **efficiency**, and **sustainability** in healthcare delivery.
