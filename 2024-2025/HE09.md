These outcomes lay the groundwork for mastering economic evaluation, enabling you to contribute to **evidence-informed policies** that optimize health outcomes within constrained budgets.

#### Why Economic Evaluation Matters üåç

Economic evaluation is more than a technical exercise‚Äîit‚Äôs a **vital tool** for addressing one of healthcare‚Äôs greatest challenges: **delivering the best possible care with limited resources**. In Malaysia and globally, health systems grapple with rising demands for services, from advanced treatments to preventive programs, while facing finite budgets, staff, and infrastructure. This lecture sets the stage for understanding how economic evaluation provides a **structured, transparent approach** to making tough choices, such as whether to fund a new cancer drug or expand vaccination programs. By comparing **costs** (e.g., financial resources spent) and **consequences** (e.g., lives saved or quality of life improved), it ensures decisions are **value-driven**, not just cost-driven.

#### Malaysia‚Äôs Context üá≤üáæ

In Malaysia, economic evaluation is particularly relevant as the nation advances toward **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)** and strengthens initiatives like **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)** through agencies such as **MaHTAS**. The lecture highlights how these tools help prioritize funding for programs like **Peka B40** (healthcare for low-income groups) or national vaccination efforts, ensuring **equity** and **efficiency** in resource allocation. By grounding the discussion in Malaysia‚Äôs health system, the lecture bridges global health economics principles with local applications, preparing students to tackle real-world challenges.

#### Structure of the Lecture üìÖ

This session introduces the **foundational principles** of economic evaluation. It covers:

- The **definition** and **purpose** of economic evaluation.
- The **types** of evaluations (e.g., CMA, CEA, CUA, CBA) and their applications.
- **Core economic concepts** like scarcity and efficiency that shape decision-making.
- The role of **perspective** in determining which costs and outcomes matter.

This introduction sets the tone for a deeper exploration of how economic evaluation transforms **data into decisions**, empowering public health professionals to make **wise choices** in the face of scarcity.

| **Key Takeaway** | **Why It Matters** |

## ü©∫ 2. The Challenge of Scarcity in Healthcare

Healthcare systems worldwide, including Malaysia‚Äôs, grapple with the **fundamental challenge** of **scarcity**: the reality that **limited resources** cannot satisfy **infinite health needs**. This unavoidable constraint forces **choices** about how to allocate resources, often resulting in **trade-offs** where funding one intervention‚Äîsuch as a new treatment or preventive program‚Äîmeans reducing support for another. This section explores the implications of scarcity, the limitations of traditional decision-making approaches, and the need for a **rational framework** to guide resource allocation, setting the stage for understanding the role of **economic evaluation** in health systems üåç.

### The Reality of Scarcity in Healthcare üí∏

Scarcity is a universal issue that shapes healthcare decision-making in every country, from high-income nations to emerging economies like Malaysia. **Healthcare systems worldwide, including Malaysia‚Äôs, face the fundamental challenge of scarcity**: there are simply not enough resources to meet all health demands. This creates a pressing need for **prioritization** to ensure that limited resources deliver the greatest possible benefit to populations.

- **Context** of Scarcity:
    
    - **Ministries encounter legitimate requests for additional funding to improve health**, such as expanding access to life-saving treatments or launching public health campaigns. However, **resources**‚Äîincluding **money**, **people**, **time**, **facilities**, and **equipment**‚Äîare **always limited in all countries** üåç.
    - A poignant quote captures this tension: _‚ÄúThe only thing that a minister of health is ever destined to discuss with the medical profession is money.‚Äù_ (Slide 3, April 10, 2025). This underscores the constant negotiation over scarce funds in healthcare.
    - **There is never enough money to do everything worth doing**, forcing health systems to make tough choices about which programs or services to prioritize. For example, investing in advanced diagnostic tools might compete with funding for community health workers.
- **Why Scarcity Matters**:
    
    - Scarcity creates a **zero-sum game** in healthcare: allocating resources to one area inevitably reduces what‚Äôs available for others. This necessitates **choices** about resource allocation, often leading to **trade-offs** where **funding one intervention means reducing support for another**.
    - **Example**: **Choosing to fund a cancer screening program** may mean **forgoing additional ICU beds**, highlighting the need for a rational decision-making framework to weigh the benefits and costs of each option. Such decisions can have profound impacts on patient outcomes and system efficiency.

### Limitations of Traditional Decision-Making ü§î

Historically, healthcare decisions have often been made without a structured, evidence-based approach, relying instead on intuition or incomplete information. **Decisions often rely on gut feelings and educated guesses**, which may not ensure **efficiency** or **equity** in resource allocation. This traditional approach is inadequate for addressing the complexities of modern healthcare systems, where the stakes are high and resources are constrained.

- **The Problem with Gut Feelings**:
    
    - **Gut feelings** may reflect personal biases or incomplete understanding of a program‚Äôs impact, leading to suboptimal choices. For instance, a policymaker might prioritize a high-profile treatment over a less visible but more cost-effective preventive measure.
    - **Educated guesses**, while informed by experience, often lack the rigor needed to compare the **costs** and **outcomes** of competing interventions systematically.
    - Such approaches risk **inefficiency** (wasting resources on low-impact programs) and **inequity** (failing to address the needs of underserved populations).
- **Need for Transparency**:
    
    - **Policymakers need informed choices** to determine which requests to support, akin to consumers who demand transparency about **contents** and **price** before purchasing a service. Just as a shopper wouldn‚Äôt buy a product without knowing its quality and cost, health decision-makers require clear data on what an intervention delivers and at what expense.
    - Without a structured framework, decisions may lack **accountability**, eroding public trust in how health funds are spent, especially in systems like Malaysia‚Äôs that emphasize **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)**.

### Implications of Scarcity and Trade-Offs ‚öñÔ∏è

The reality of scarcity has profound implications for how healthcare systems operate and make decisions. **Supporting one service means cutting back on others**, creating a ripple effect across the system. This section emphasizes the need for a **rational decision-making framework** to navigate these trade-offs effectively.

- **Trade-Offs in Action**:
    
    - **Supporting one service means cutting back on others**, as resources are finite. For example, allocating funds to a new dialysis center might reduce the budget for maternal health programs, potentially affecting different patient groups.
    - These trade-offs are not just financial but also involve **human resources** (e.g., doctors‚Äô time), **infrastructure** (e.g., hospital beds), and **time** (e.g., delays in other services).
- **Rational Framework Needed**:
    
    - The **example** of **choosing to fund a cancer screening program** versus **additional ICU beds** illustrates the stakes. A cancer screening program might prevent future cases but requires upfront investment, while ICU beds address immediate critical care needs. Deciding between them requires weighing **long-term benefits** against **urgent demands**, a process that gut feelings cannot adequately support.
    - **Highlighting the need for a rational decision-making framework**, economic evaluation emerges as a solution. By systematically comparing **costs** (e.g., program expenses) and **consequences** (e.g., lives saved or quality of life improved), it provides a transparent, evidence-based approach to prioritization.

### Malaysia‚Äôs Context and Beyond üá≤üáæ

In Malaysia, scarcity is a pressing issue as the country works toward **UHC** and equitable healthcare access through initiatives like **Peka B40** and **national vaccination programs**. The challenge of balancing **legitimate requests** for funding‚Äîsuch as expanding rural clinics or subsidizing new drugs‚Äîagainst **limited budgets** mirrors global health system struggles. This section underscores the universal relevance of scarcity, with Malaysia as a key example, and sets the stage for how **economic evaluation** can address these challenges by ensuring **efficiency**, **equity**, and **transparency**.

|**Key Takeaway**|**Why It Matters**|
|---|---|
|**Scarcity** limits resources in all health systems|Forces **prioritization** and **trade-offs**|
|**Gut feelings** and **guesses** are inadequate|Risks **inefficiency** and **inequity**|
|**Rational frameworks** like economic evaluation are essential|Ensures **informed**, **transparent** decisions|

By understanding the challenge of scarcity, students are better prepared to appreciate the role of **economic evaluation** in transforming **constrained resources** into **maximum health gains**, a topic explored in subsequent sections of the lecture üåü.

## üìà 3. Defining Economic Evaluation

**Economic evaluation** is a cornerstone of health economics, providing a **structured approach** to compare healthcare interventions and determine their **value for money**. By systematically analyzing both **costs** and **consequences**, it empowers policymakers to make **informed decisions** in the face of scarce resources. This section defines economic evaluation, outlines its **key characteristics**, clarifies its **purpose**, and illustrates its application with a practical example, laying the foundation for understanding its role in health systems like Malaysia‚Äôs üåç.

### üìñ What is Economic Evaluation? üß†

At its core, **economic evaluation** is a powerful tool that goes beyond simple budgeting to assess the true worth of healthcare interventions. **Definition**: _‚ÄúA comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences.‚Äù_

- **Source**: Drummond et al. (2005), a seminal reference in health economics.
- **Role**: It serves as a **central tool** in health economics, moving beyond **cost accounting** (merely tracking expenses) to evaluate **value for money** üí∞. This means assessing not just how much an intervention costs, but whether its benefits justify the expenditure.
- **Applications**: Economic evaluation is versatile, applied to a wide range of healthcare areas, including **drugs** (e.g., new medications), **devices** (e.g., diagnostic tools), **programs** (e.g., vaccination campaigns), **services** (e.g., outpatient care), and **policies** (e.g., national health guidelines).

In Malaysia, for instance, economic evaluation might be used to decide whether a new cancer drug should be included in the **MyHEALTH** formulary or whether a community dental program delivers sufficient health benefits for its cost. By focusing on **value**, it ensures resources are used wisely to maximize health outcomes.

### üîç Key Characteristics of Economic Evaluation üìã

Economic evaluation is distinguished by its **rigorous, comparative, and transparent** approach to decision-making. Its **key characteristics** ensure it provides reliable, reproducible insights for health systems:

- **Comparative**: **Always compares at least two alternatives** to determine which offers better value. Examples include:
    
    - A **new drug** versus **standard care** (e.g., a novel diabetes medication vs. existing treatment).
    - **Hospital-based care** versus **home-based care** (e.g., post-surgical recovery settings).
    - A **preventive intervention** versus **no intervention** (e.g., HPV vaccination vs. no vaccination).  
        This comparative nature ensures decisions are grounded in **relative performance**, not isolated assessments.
- **Dual Focus**: **Examines both costs and outcomes**, ensuring decisions consider **effectiveness** alongside **resource use**.
    
    - **Costs** include financial expenditures, such as staff salaries or equipment purchases.
    - **Outcomes** measure health impacts, such as lives saved or quality of life improved.  
        This dual lens prevents decisions based solely on price, prioritizing interventions that deliver meaningful health gains.
- **Systematic & Structured**: **Uses defined methods and models**, ensuring **transparency** and **reproducibility**.
    
    - **Defined methods** might include standardized protocols for costing or outcome measurement.
    - **Models** could involve decision trees or cost-effectiveness analyses.
    - **Transparency** allows stakeholders (e.g., Malaysia‚Äôs Ministry of Health) to understand and trust the evaluation process.
    - **Reproducibility** ensures results can be verified or replicated, enhancing credibility.

These characteristics make economic evaluation a **robust tool** for navigating complex healthcare decisions, particularly in resource-constrained settings like Malaysia‚Äôs public health system.

### üí° Purpose of Economic Evaluation üéØ

The **purpose** of economic evaluation is to guide healthcare decisions by answering a critical question: _‚ÄúIs the added benefit of this option worth the additional cost?‚Äù_ This question is at the heart of resource allocation, especially when budgets are tight and health needs are vast.

- **Objectives**:
    - **Supports efficient allocation** of limited health resources, ensuring that scarce funds, staff, and facilities are used where they can do the most good.
    - **Helps decide which interventions to adopt, scale up, delay, or reject**, providing a clear framework for prioritization. For example, should Malaysia **adopt** a new vaccine, **scale up** an existing screening program, **delay** a costly procedure, or **reject** an intervention with minimal benefits?
    - **Prioritizes interventions with high value for money**, focusing on options that deliver significant health outcomes relative to their costs.

By addressing these objectives, economic evaluation ensures that health systems, including Malaysia‚Äôs, achieve **equity** (fair resource distribution), **efficiency** (maximum health gains per Ringgit), and **sustainability** (long-term affordability).

### üìä Example: Comparing Treatment Options ‚öñÔ∏è

To illustrate how economic evaluation works in practice, consider a **scenario** comparing two treatment options, as presented in the lecture. This example highlights how costs and outcomes are weighed to inform decision-making.

- **Scenario**: Comparing two treatment options:
    
    |**Option**|**Cost (RM)**|**Effectiveness (Life Years Gained)**|**Cost per Life Year**|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |A (Standard Care)|10,000|3|RM 3,333|
    |B (New Treatment)|14,000|4|RM 3,500|
    
- **Analysis**:
    
    - **Option A (Standard Care)** costs **RM 10,000** and yields **3 life years**, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of **RM 3,333 per life year** ($ \frac{10,000}{3} \approx 3,333 $).
    - **Option B (New Treatment)** costs **RM 14,000** and yields **4 life years**, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of **RM 3,500 per life year** ($ \frac{14,000}{4} = 3,500 $).
    - The **incremental difference** is an additional **RM 4,000** for **1 extra life year** in Option B.
- **Decision Considerations**:
    
    - **Is the extra RM 4,000 for Option B justified by the additional year of life?** This depends on the health system‚Äôs willingness to pay for a life year, often guided by thresholds (e.g., Malaysia‚Äôs HTA guidelines via **MaHTAS**).
    - **Could that RM 4,000 yield more value elsewhere** (e.g., funding another intervention, like a vaccination program)? This reflects the concept of **opportunity cost**, where resources spent on one option cannot be used for another.

This example demonstrates how economic evaluation provides a **clear, data-driven basis** for comparing interventions, helping policymakers weigh **costs** against **health benefits** to make informed choices.

### Why This Matters in Malaysia and Beyond üá≤üáæ

In Malaysia, where initiatives like **Peka B40** and **national formularies** aim to improve health equity, economic evaluation is critical for deciding which interventions to prioritize. For instance, should the government invest in a costly new drug or expand access to preventive services? By defining economic evaluation as a **comparative**, **systematic**, and **value-focused** tool, this section prepares students to apply these principles to real-world challenges, ensuring **transparency** and **accountability** in health spending. Globally, the same principles guide decisions in resource-constrained settings, making economic evaluation a **universal tool** for better healthcare.

|**Key Takeaway**|**Why It Matters**|
|---|---|
|**Economic evaluation** compares **costs** and **consequences**|Ensures **value for money** over mere cost-cutting|
|**Comparative** and **systematic** approach|Provides **transparent**, **reproducible** results|
|Answers: _‚ÄúIs the benefit worth the cost?‚Äù_|Guides **efficient**, **equitable** resource allocation|

By mastering the definition and purpose of economic evaluation, students are equipped to tackle the complexities of healthcare decision-making, transforming **scarce resources** into **maximum health impact** üåü.

## üí∞ 4. Understanding Costs and Consequences

### üìã Costs
- **Definition**: *The value of resources used in an intervention.*
- **Types**:
  - **Direct Medical Costs**: Hospital stays, medications, staff time ü©∫.
  - **Direct Non-Medical Costs**: Transport, caregiving üöó.
  - **Indirect Costs**: Productivity losses due to illness or treatment üíº.
  - **Intangible Costs**: Pain, anxiety (rarely monetized due to measurement challenges) üòü.
- **Process**: Costs must be **identified**, **measured**, and **valued** based on the chosen **perspective**.

### üìä Consequences
- **Definition**: *The outcomes or effects of an intervention.*
- **Types**:
  - **Clinical**: Infections prevented, life years gained üìà.
  - **Preference-Weighted**: Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) ‚öñÔ∏è.
  - **Economic**: Monetized outcomes (e.g., in cost-benefit analysis) üíµ.
- **Requirements**:
  - Outcomes should be **meaningful** to patients and providers.
  - Must be **measurable** over a relevant **time horizon**.

## üåç 5. Relevance to Health Systems

### üìñ Why Economic Evaluation Matters
- **Limited Budgets**: Healthcare budgets are finite, while **demand** for services is rising üìâ.
- **Ensures**:
  - **Transparency** in decision-making.
  - **Accountability** in spending public funds.
  - **Fair** and **efficient** use of resources.
- **Applications**:
  - **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)**: Evaluating new drugs or devices (e.g., MaHTAS in Malaysia).
  - **National Formulary Listing**: Deciding which drugs to include (e.g., MyHEALTH, MyHD lists).
  - **Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Initiatives**: Prioritizing interventions for equitable access üåê.

### üìà Malaysia‚Äôs Context
- **Challenge**: Malaysia‚Äôs health system faces **scarcity** in delivering optimal outcomes with limited resources.
- **Role of Economic Evaluation**:
  - Prioritizes **funding** for high-impact programs (e.g., Peka B40, Vaccination Programme).
  - Improves **health equity** by targeting vulnerable populations.
  - Maximizes **health gains** per Ringgit spent.
  - Ensures **transparency** and **accountability** in public health spending üá≤üáæ.

## üìä 6. Types of Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluation encompasses four main types, each differing in **outcome measurement** and **decision focus**. These types guide policymakers in selecting interventions based on **cost-effectiveness** and **value**.

### üìã Overview
| **Type** | **Outcome Measure** | **Decision Focus** |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **CMA**  | Same outcome        | Which is cheaper?  |
| **CEA**  | Natural units (e.g., life years) | Which gives more health for the cost? |
| **CUA**  | Utility-based (e.g., QALYs) | Which gives more value considering quality of life? |
| **CBA**  | Money (RM)          | Do monetary benefits exceed costs? |

### üîç Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)
- **Use Case**: When two or more interventions have **proven identical outcomes**, focusing solely on **cost differences**.
- **Examples**:
  - Choosing between **bioequivalent generic drugs** with different prices.
  - Selecting between **diagnostic labs** with identical test accuracy.
- **Key Limitation**: Rarely used, as strong evidence of **equal outcomes** is required.

### üìà Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)
- **Outcome Measure**: **Natural units** (e.g., life years gained, cases detected, hospital admissions avoided).
- **Examples**:
  - Comparing **cancer screening methods** based on **cost per case detected**.
  - Assessing a new **heart failure drug** by **cost per life year gained**.
- **Output**: **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, e.g., RM 50,000 per life year gained.
  $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\Delta \text{Cost}}{\Delta \text{Effectiveness}} $$
- **Use Case**: When outcomes are important but **quality of life** is not the primary focus.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)
- **Outcome Measure**: **Utility-based measures** like **QALYs** or **DALYs**, capturing both **quantity** and **quality of life**.
- **Examples**:
  - Evaluating **cancer treatment** with toxic side effects.
  - Comparing **surgery** vs. **physiotherapy** in elderly patients.
- **Output**: **Cost per QALY gained**, e.g., RM 100,000/QALY.
- **Key Feature**: Most commonly recommended for **Health Technology Assessment (HTA)** due to its comprehensive outcome measure.
- **Malaysia Example**: Used in **MaHTAS** evaluations for drug approvals.

### üíµ Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)
- **Outcome Measure**: All outcomes converted into **monetary value** (RM).
- **Key Question**: *‚ÄúDo the benefits (in RM) outweigh the costs?‚Äù*
- **Examples**:
  - Evaluating a **workplace health program** based on **saved productivity**.
  - Assessing **safety interventions** by monetizing lives saved.
- **Advantage**: Allows comparison across **non-health sectors** (e.g., health vs. education).
- **Challenge**: Monetizing **life**, **pain**, or **suffering** is **ethically** and **methodologically controversial**.

### üìä Summary Table
| **Type** | **Outcome**         | **Example**                     | **Key Limitation**                |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| **CMA**  | Same outcomes       | Two bioequivalent drugs         | Rare in practice                  |
| **CEA**  | Natural units       | Cost per case prevented         | Doesn‚Äôt value quality of life     |
| **CUA**  | QALYs/DALYs         | Cancer treatment analysis       | Requires utility data             |
| **CBA**  | RM                  | Workplace wellness ROI          | Hard to monetize outcomes         |

### üß† Choosing the Right Type
- **Context** and **decision needs** determine the best approach.
- **Decision Tree** (Slide 27, incomplete in original):
  - If **effectiveness** is unknown, economic evaluation is premature.
  - If outcomes are **identical**, use **CMA**.
  - If **natural units** suffice, use **CEA**.
  - If **quality of life** matters, use **CUA**.
  - If **monetary comparison** across sectors is needed, use **CBA**.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è 7. Partial vs. Full Economic Evaluation

### üìñ Definitions
- **Partial Evaluation**: A **cost-outcome study** that evaluates a **single course of action** without a formal comparator.
  - *Example*: Assessing the cost and outcomes of a new vaccine program without comparing it to an alternative.
- **Full Economic Evaluation**: Compares **two or more alternative courses of action** in terms of **costs** and **consequences**.
  - *Example*: Comparing a new vaccine to standard care or no intervention.

### üìä Key Difference
- **Partial**: Lacks a **comparator**, limiting its ability to assess **relative value**.
- **Full**: Explicitly evaluates **alternatives**, providing a robust basis for decision-making.
- **Figure 1 (Slide 28)**: Illustrates partial evaluations as single-option analyses vs. full evaluations with multiple comparators.

---

## üß† 8. Core Economic Concepts

Understanding **economic principles** is essential for conducting and interpreting economic evaluations, ensuring decisions are **value-driven** rather than solely **cost-driven**.

### üìã Key Concepts
| **Concept**          | **Practical Importance**                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Opportunity Cost** | Recognizes **trade-offs** in decisions       |
| **Scarcity**         | Explains why **prioritization** is needed    |
| **Efficiency**       | Promotes **maximum value** from resources    |
| **Marginal Analysis**| Helps fine-tune **decision thresholds**      |

#### **Opportunity Cost**
- **Definition**: *The value of the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made.*
- **In Healthcare**:
  - Funding a **cancer screening program** may mean not funding **additional ICU beds**.
  - Spending **RM 1 million** on Drug A means forgoing what that money could achieve elsewhere (e.g., vaccinations).
- **Takeaway**: Every decision involves a **trade-off** üí∏.

#### **Scarcity**
- **Definition**: *Resources (money, staff, time, technology) are limited, but health needs are unlimited.*
- **Real Terms**:
  - Insufficient **doctors**, **nurses**, or **funds** to meet all demands.
  - Inability to provide **every treatment** to every patient.
- **Implication**: Scarcity forces **choices**, and economic evaluation guides them rationally üåç.

#### **Efficiency in Healthcare**
- **Definition**: *Achieving maximum benefit from available resources.*
- **Types**:
  - **Technical Efficiency**: Producing a given output at the **lowest cost** (e.g., using **generic drugs** instead of branded).
  - **Allocative Efficiency**: Allocating resources to **maximize population health** (e.g., prioritizing **vaccinations** over rare-disease treatments).
- **Goal**: More **health gains** per Ringgit spent üìà.

#### **Marginal Analysis**
- **Definition**: *Examines the additional (marginal) cost and benefit of increasing or decreasing an activity by a small amount.*
- **In Practice**:
  - What is the **extra cost** of screening **1,000 more people**?
  - Does the **additional benefit** justify the added cost?
- **Output**: **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, measuring cost per additional outcome unit.
  $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\Delta \text{Cost}}{\Delta \text{Effectiveness}} $$
- **Application**: Fine-tunes decisions to optimize resource use üß†.

## üëÅÔ∏è 9. Perspective in Economic Evaluation

### üìñ What is Perspective?
- **Definition**: *The perspective of an economic evaluation defines whose costs and benefits are included in the analysis.*
- **Role**: Guides:
  - **Types of costs** included (e.g., medical, non-medical).
  - **Whose outcomes** matter (e.g., patients, society).
  - **Scope** of the evaluation (broad or narrow).
- **Importance**: Choosing the right perspective is **critical**, as it directly affects **study conclusions**.

### üìä Common Perspectives
| **Perspective**      | **Includes**                          | **Often Used By**                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Societal**         | All costs/benefits (direct, indirect, intangible) | Academics, global health              |
| **Health System/Provider** | Medical costs only (e.g., drugs, hospital stays) | Ministries of Health, public hospitals |
| **Payer**            | Costs borne by insurer/funding agency | Insurance companies, governments      |
| **Patient**          | Out-of-pocket and indirect costs      | Patient advocacy, equity studies      |

#### **Societal Perspective**
- **Scope**: Most **comprehensive**, including:
  - **Medical costs** (e.g., hospital stays).
  - **Non-medical costs** (e.g., transport).
  - **Productivity losses**.
  - **Informal caregiving**.
  - **Intangible costs** (e.g., pain, suffering).
- **Pros**:
  - Captures **total societal impact**.
  - Ideal for **macro-level policy decisions**.
- **Cons**:
  - **Data-intensive**.
  - Not always feasible for **local** or **budget-specific** contexts.
- **Recommended By**: WHO, OECD, and for **cost-utility analyses**.

#### **Health System/Provider Perspective**
- **Scope**: Focuses on costs to the **public health system** or **provider**, including:
  - **Hospital stays**, **medications**, **staff time**, **equipment**.
- **Excludes**: **Patient OOP costs**, **productivity losses**.
- **Suitable For**:
  - **Government budget planning**.
  - **HTA submissions** (e.g., MaHTAS in Malaysia).

#### **Payer Perspective**
- **Scope**: Costs borne by **third-party payers** (e.g., insurance companies, government schemes).
- **Includes**: **Reimbursed medical expenses**, **claims paid out**.
- **Relevance**: Contexts with **insured** or **subsidized services** (e.g., MySalam, private insurance in Malaysia).
- **Limitation**: May ignore **downstream societal costs** or **patient burdens**.

#### **Patient Perspective**
- **Scope**: Costs to the **individual**, including:
  - **OOP medical expenses**.
  - **Travel**, **food**, **lodging** costs.
  - **Income loss** due to illness or caregiving.
- **Importance**:
  - **Equity analyses**.
  - Evaluating **financial hardship** and **catastrophic health spending**.
- **Example**: Studies on **cancer care affordability** in Malaysia.

### üìà Example: Breast Cancer Treatment
- **Scenario**: Evaluating a new targeted therapy.
- **Results by Perspective**:
  | **Perspective** | **Evaluation Result** |
  |-----------------|-----------------------|
  | **Societal**    | High cost, but offset by survival, return to work, reduced caregiver burden = **Cost-effective** |
  | **Health System**| Expensive, limited budget impact = **Not cost-effective** |
  | **Patient**     | High OOP cost despite subsidies = **Financially toxic** |
- **Insight**: The **same intervention** yields **different conclusions** based on perspective.

### üß† Why Perspective Matters
- **Determines**:
  - What **costs** and **outcomes** are included.
  - **Who benefits** or **pays**.
  - What **decision** is supported.
- **Alignment**: Perspective must match:
  - The **policy question**.
  - The **target audience** (e.g., Ministry of Health, patients).
  - **Data availability**.

## ‚è∞ 10. Timing and Situations for Economic Evaluation

### üìñ Why Timing Matters
- **Purpose-Driven**: Economic evaluation should be conducted when a **decision** about **resource allocation** is needed.
- **Contextual Relevance**: The **timing** and **context** determine the evaluation‚Äôs **usefulness**.

### üìã Situations Calling for Economic Evaluation
1. **Introduction of New Health Interventions**:
   - **Context**: New **drug**, **vaccine**, **diagnostic test**, or **surgical procedure**.
   - **Question**: *Is this intervention worth adopting given its cost and benefit?*
   - **Example**: Introducing a new **breast cancer therapy** under Malaysia‚Äôs national formulary ü©∫.

2. **Scaling Up Existing Interventions**:
   - **Context**: Expanding **pilot programs** to **national** or **state** levels.
   - **Question**: *Is the intervention still cost-effective at a larger scale?*
   - **Example**: Extending the **HPV vaccination program** to older age groups üíâ.

3. **Choosing Between Alternatives**:
   - **Context**: Comparing **two or more options** delivering similar services.
   - **Question**: *Which one offers more value for money?*
   - **Example**: Comparing **telehealth** vs. **physical outpatient visits** for chronic disease follow-up üì±.

4. **Budget Allocation and Priority Setting**:
   - **Context**: Multiple programs **competing** for the same funds.
   - **Question**: *Which programs should be funded, expanded, or defunded?*
   - **Example**: Deciding between **dialysis services** or **preventive diabetes screening** in rural Malaysia üè•.

5. **Addressing Concerns About Efficiency**:
   - **Context**: Suspected **inefficient** or **outdated** interventions.
   - **Question**: *Are we spending too much for too little benefit?*
   - **Example**: Re-evaluating **national health screening guidelines** with low detection rates üìä.

### üö´ When Evaluation is Less Useful
- **Avoid Conducting When**:
  - **Outcomes** or **effectiveness** are **unknown** or **highly uncertain**.
  - **Costs** are **trivial** and unlikely to influence decisions.
  - The intervention is **not scalable** or **politically infeasible**.
- **Requirement**: High-quality **effectiveness data** are essential for meaningful evaluation.

### üìÖ Summary: When to Conduct
- **Conduct When**:
  - A new **resource allocation decision** is needed.
  - There are **competing interventions**.
  - The goal is to **maximize health benefit** within budget constraints.
  - **Evidence** will inform **policy**, **procurement**, or **program expansion**.
- **Tip**: Align evaluation timing with **planning** or **budgeting cycles** for maximum impact.
