Through case studies and practical examples, it illustrates how to assess the **cost-effectiveness** of interventions, ensuring **efficiency**, **equity**, and **sustainability** in health policy.

### üß† Key Learning Outcomes

The lecture enables participants to:  
- **Outline** the **10 key steps** for conducting a full economic evaluation, ensuring a systematic approach.  
- **Identify and measure** relevant **costs** (direct, indirect, intangible) and **health outcomes** (e.g., QALYs, life-years gained).  
- **Apply** core concepts like **discounting**, **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, and **sensitivity analysis** to assess interventions.  
- **Understand** the role of **modeling** (e.g., decision trees, Markov models) in simulating long-term outcomes.

### üìä Core Concepts and Methodologies

#### üîÑ Introduction to Economic Evaluation

**Economic evaluation (EE)** is defined as **"a comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences"** (Drummond et al., 2005). It supports **efficient resource allocation** by systematically comparing the **cost** and **value** of health interventions, such as new drugs or vaccination programs, to maximize health outcomes in Malaysia‚Äôs resource-constrained health system.

- **Types of Economic Evaluation**:  
  The lecture introduces four main types, each with distinct **outcome measures** and **decision foci**:  

| **Type** | **Outcome Measure** | **Decision Focus** |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **CMA (Cost-Minimization Analysis)** | Same outcomes | Which is cheaper? |
| **CEA (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis)** | Natural units (e.g., life-years gained) | More health for the cost? |
| **CUA (Cost-Utility Analysis)** | Utility-based (e.g., QALYs, DALYs) | Value considering quality of life? |
| **CBA (Cost-Benefit Analysis)** | Monetary (e.g., RM) | Do benefits exceed costs? |

#### ‚öñÔ∏è Key Economic Principles

Economic evaluations are grounded in four principles:  
- **Scarcity**: Limited resources (e.g., money, staff) necessitate prioritization.  
- **Opportunity Cost**: The value of the next best alternative forgone (e.g., funding dialysis vs. cancer screening).  
- **Efficiency**: Maximizing health outcomes per resource unit, via **technical** (lowest cost for output) and **allocative** (maximizing population health) efficiency.  
- **Marginal Analysis**: Evaluating incremental costs and effects, using the **ICER**.

#### üëÄ Importance of Perspective

**Perspective** defines **whose costs and benefits are counted**, shaping the evaluation‚Äôs scope. The lecture highlights four perspectives:

| **Perspective** | **Costs Included** | **Common Use** |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Societal** | All costs (direct, indirect, intangible) | Broad policy |
| **Health System** | Direct medical costs | HTA, Ministries |
| **Payer** | Reimbursed costs | Insurers, MySalam |
| **Patient** | Out-of-pocket, lost income | Equity studies |

**Key Insight**: The **same intervention** (e.g., a new cancer drug) can yield **different conclusions** based on perspective, such as **cost-effective** (societal) or **financially toxic** (patient).

#### üõ†Ô∏è Conducting a Full Economic Evaluation

A **full economic evaluation** follows a **10-step process**:  
1. **Define the Problem and Comparators**: Clearly state the issue and alternatives (e.g., new HPV vaccine vs. existing program).  
2. **Choose Perspective**: Determines costs and benefits included.  
3. **Set Time Horizon**: Duration for measuring outcomes (e.g., 5 years, lifetime).  
4. **Identify, Measure, Value Costs**: Categorize and quantify resources (e.g., drugs, travel).  
5. **Identify and Measure Outcomes**: Select meaningful metrics (e.g., QALYs).  
6. **Apply Discounting**: Adjust future values to present value at $3\%-5\%$.  
7. **Conduct Incremental Analysis**: Calculate **ICER** to compare interventions.  
8. **Perform Sensitivity Analysis**: Test uncertainty‚Äôs impact.  
9. **Use Modeling**: Simulate long-term outcomes.  
10. **Interpret and Present Results**: Align findings with policy priorities.

**Example**: Evaluating a **mobile dental clinic** vs. a **subsidy scheme** in rural Malaysia, using a 5-year horizon and health system perspective, with an ICER of RM per QALY.

#### üí∞ Understanding Costs

**Cost** is the **value of resources consumed** (e.g., drugs, staff time). Costs are categorized as:  
- **Direct Medical**: Health system costs (e.g., chemotherapy drugs).  
- **Direct Non-Medical**: Access-related costs (e.g., patient travel).  
- **Indirect**: Productivity losses (e.g., sick leave).  
- **Intangible**: Non-financial costs (e.g., pain, anxiety).  

The **costing process** involves:  
1. **Identification**: List resources (e.g., chemo sessions).  
2. **Measurement**: Quantify use (e.g., 6 cycles).  
3. **Valuation**: Assign monetary values (e.g., RM1,500/cycle).  

**Micro-costing** (detailed) vs. **gross-costing** (average) approaches balance precision and effort.

#### üìä Outcomes in Economic Evaluation

**Outcomes** are the **health consequences** of interventions, measured as:  
- **Natural Units** (CEA): Life-years gained, cases detected.  
- **Utility-Based** (CUA): **QALYs** (combining life length and quality, $0$ = death, $1$ = perfect health).  
- **Monetary** (CBA): RM value of benefits (e.g., productivity).  

**Utilities** are measured via **EQ-5D**, **Time Trade-Off**, or **Standard Gamble**, using published weights or patient data.

#### ‚è∞ Timing and Discounting

**Timing** matters due to **time preference** (valuing benefits now over later). **Discounting** adjusts future costs/outcomes to present value at **$3\%-5\%$**, critical for horizons exceeding 1 year. **Time horizon** varies:  
- Acute illness: ‚â§1 year.  
- Chronic disease: Lifetime (10‚Äì20 years).  
- Preventive: Until outcomes occur.  

**Example**: A breast cancer treatment yields $0.8$ QALYs undiscounted, $\approx 0.76$ QALYs at $3\%$.

#### üìà Incremental Analysis and ICER

**Incremental analysis** compares **additional costs** and **benefits**, using the **ICER**:  
$$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{New}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{Comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{New}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{Comparator}}} $$

**Example**: Drug A (RM60,000, 2.0 QALYs) vs. Drug B (RM20,000, 1.5 QALYs) yields an ICER of **80,000 RM/QALY**.  
- **Thresholds**:  
  - **WTP**: RM90,000‚Äì120,000/QALY (Malaysia).  
  - **GDP-based**: RM50,000‚Äì150,000/QALY.  
  - **Opportunity cost**: RM30,000‚Äì50,000/QALY.  

#### üîç Sensitivity Analysis

**Sensitivity analysis** tests uncertainty in parameters (e.g., costs, utilities), answering **"How much would conclusions change?"** Types include:  
- **One-way**: Vary one parameter (e.g., drug cost).  
- **Multi-way**: Vary multiple parameters.  
- **Probabilistic**: Use Monte Carlo simulations.  
- **Threshold**: Identify break-even points.  

**Visualization**: **Tornado diagrams** show parameter influence.

#### üßÆ Economic Modeling

**Economic models** simulate clinical/economic processes, using:  
- **Decision Trees**: For short-term decisions.  
- **Markov Models**: For chronic conditions, with **states**, **cycles**, **transition probabilities**, and **utilities/costs**.  

**Example**: Modeling breast cancer to estimate lifetime QALYs.

#### ü©∫ Case Study: HER2+ Breast Cancer

**Drug A** (RM60,000, 2.0 QALYs) vs. **Drug B** (RM20,000, 1.5 QALYs):  
- **ICER**: 80,000 RM/QALY.  
- **Interpretation**: Cost-effective at RM100,000/QALY, not at RM50,000/QALY, depending on **budget**, **disease severity**, and **equity**.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

Avoid:  
1. **Inappropriate perspective**: Misaligning costs/outcomes.  
2. **Incorrect costing**: Using outdated prices.  
3. **Inadequate time horizon**: Missing long-term effects.  
4. **No discounting**: Overvaluing future benefits.  
5. **Weak sensitivity analysis**: Ignoring uncertainty.  
6. **ICER misuse**: Omitting comparisons.  
7. **Lack of transparency**: Unclear assumptions.

- **Efficiency**: Maximizing health per resource unit.  
- **Marginal Analysis**: Evaluating incremental costs/effects.  
- **Perspective**: Whose costs/benefits are counted (societal, health system, payer, patient).  
- **Time Horizon**: Duration of cost/outcome measurement.  
- **Discounting**: Adjusting future values to present value ($3\%-5\%$).  
- **ICER**: Cost per additional health unit (e.g., RM/QALY).  
- **QALY**: Quality-Adjusted Life Year ($0$ = death, $1$ = perfect health).  
- **DALY**: Disability-Adjusted Life Year.  
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Testing uncertainty‚Äôs impact.  
- **Decision Tree**: Model for short-term decisions.  
- **Markov Model**: Model for chronic conditions with health states and cycles.

## üìñ 1. Introduction to Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluation is a cornerstone of health economics, providing a structured framework to guide resource allocation decisions in healthcare. This section introduces the **core concepts**, **learning outcomes**, and **types** of economic evaluation, setting the stage for understanding how to conduct robust evaluations that maximize health outcomes within limited resources. By systematically comparing costs and consequences, economic evaluation ensures **transparent**, **evidence-based**, and **efficient** decision-making in health systems.

### üåü What is Economic Evaluation?

**Definition**: Economic evaluation (EE) is **"a comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences"** (Drummond et al., 2005).  
This definition underscores the essence of EE as a tool that weighs both the **resources consumed** and the **health outcomes achieved** to determine the value of health interventions.

- **Core Idea**: EE helps decision-makers **allocate limited resources efficiently** by evaluating both costs and outcomes. It moves beyond simple cost accounting to focus on **value for money**, ensuring that health systems prioritize interventions that deliver the greatest health benefits relative to their costs.
- **Purpose**: EE supports **wise decision-making** in healthcare by systematically comparing the cost and value of interventions. It provides a framework for policymakers, health professionals, and researchers to make **informed choices** about which interventions to adopt, scale, or reject, particularly in resource-constrained environments like Malaysia‚Äôs public health system.
- **Applications**: EE is used to assess a wide range of interventions, including **new drugs**, **vaccination programs**, **diagnostic tests**, and **health policies**, ensuring that resources are used to maximize population health.

By providing a **structured** and **transparent** approach, economic evaluation enables health systems to navigate the challenges of **scarcity** and make decisions that are **defensible** and **aligned with health priorities**.

### üß† Learning Outcomes

These outcomes provide a practical foundation for applying economic evaluation in **public health practice**, **policy development**, and **research**, enabling you to contribute to **efficient** and **equitable** health systems.

### üìä Types of Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluations vary based on their **outcome measures** and **decision focus**, allowing flexibility to address different health policy questions. The table below summarizes the **four main types** of economic evaluation, each tailored to specific contexts and goals:

| **Type** | **Outcome Measure** | **Decision Focus** |
|----------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **CMA** (Cost-Minimization Analysis) | Same outcomes | Which is cheaper? |
| **CEA** (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis) | Natural units (e.g., life-years gained) | Which gives more health for the cost? |
| **CUA** (Cost-Utility Analysis) | Utility-based (e.g., QALYs, DALYs) | Which gives more value considering quality of life (QoL)? |
| **CBA** (Cost-Benefit Analysis) | Monetary (e.g., RM) | Do the monetary benefits exceed the costs? |

- **Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)**: Used when interventions have **proven identical outcomes**, focusing solely on cost differences. For example, choosing between two bioequivalent generic drugs with different prices.  
  - **Note**: CMA is **rarely used** unless equivalency of outcomes is rigorously proven, as even small differences in effectiveness require other evaluation types.
- **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**: Measures outcomes in **natural units** like life-years gained or cases detected. It is ideal for comparing interventions where **clinical outcomes** are the primary concern, such as screening programs or survival-focused treatments.
- **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)**: Uses **utility-based measures** like Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) or Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) to capture both **quantity** and **quality of life**. CUA is widely used in **Health Technology Assessments (HTA)** due to its comprehensive approach to health outcomes.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**: Converts all outcomes into **monetary values** (e.g., RM), allowing comparisons across health and non-health sectors. For example, assessing a workplace health program‚Äôs return on investment through productivity gains.  
  - **Challenge**: Monetizing outcomes like life or suffering is ethically and methodologically complex.

**Key Insight**: The choice of evaluation type depends on the **decision context**, **available data**, and **stakeholder needs**. For instance, Malaysia‚Äôs **MaHTAS** often prefers CUA for HTA due to its focus on quality of life, while CBA may be used for cross-sector policy decisions.

**Practical Example**:  
- **CMA**: Comparing two generic antibiotics with identical efficacy to select the cheaper option for a hospital formulary.  
- **CEA**: Evaluating two cancer screening methods based on **cost per case detected** to determine which is more effective for early detection.  
- **CUA**: Assessing a new cancer drug‚Äôs **cost per QALY** to balance survival gains with side effects.  
- **CBA**: Analyzing a vaccination program‚Äôs **monetary benefits** (e.g., reduced healthcare costs and productivity losses) against its costs.

By understanding these types, you can select the appropriate method to address specific health policy questions, ensuring **relevant** and **actionable** results.

## ü©∫ 2. Recap of Economic Evaluation Basics

This section revisits the foundational principles and concepts that underpin **economic evaluation (EE)**, providing a critical starting point for understanding how to conduct robust evaluations in healthcare. By exploring **key economic principles** and the **importance of perspective**, we establish the theoretical and practical framework for evaluating health interventions. These concepts ensure that evaluations are **systematic**, **transparent**, and **aligned with decision-making needs**, enabling health systems to allocate limited resources efficiently and equitably.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Key Economic Principles

Economic evaluations are grounded in fundamental economic concepts that shape how resources are prioritized and allocated in healthcare. **These principles underpin all evaluation frameworks and are essential for decision-making**, providing the theoretical backbone for assessing the value of health interventions. By understanding these principles, you can navigate the complexities of resource scarcity and make **value-driven** decisions that maximize health outcomes.

- **Scarcity**: **Resources are limited, so choices must be made**.  
  - In healthcare, resources such as **money**, **staff**, **time**, **facilities**, and **equipment** are finite, while health needs are virtually unlimited.  
  - **Implication**: Health systems must prioritize interventions, deciding which programs to fund, scale, or discontinue. For example, a health ministry might need to choose between funding a new cancer drug or expanding rural health clinics, as there are not enough resources to do both fully.  
  - **Role in EE**: Economic evaluation helps identify interventions that deliver the greatest health benefits within these constraints, ensuring efficient use of scarce resources.

- **Opportunity Cost**: **The value of the next best alternative foregone**.  
  - Every decision to allocate resources to one intervention means sacrificing the benefits that could have been achieved by investing in another.  
  - **Example**: Spending RM1 million on a new dialysis center may mean forgoing a vaccination program that could prevent thousands of infections. The opportunity cost is the health benefits lost from not implementing the vaccination program.  
  - **Role in EE**: Economic evaluation quantifies these trade-offs, allowing decision-makers to weigh the benefits of the chosen intervention against the value of alternatives, ensuring **informed** and **strategic** resource allocation.

- **Efficiency**: **Maximize health outcomes per unit of resource**.  
  - Efficiency is about achieving the greatest possible health benefits‚Äîsuch as lives saved, diseases prevented, or quality of life improved‚Äîfor the resources invested.  
  - **Types of Efficiency**:  
    - **Technical Efficiency**: Delivering a specific health outcome at the lowest possible cost (e.g., using generic drugs instead of branded ones to achieve the same therapeutic effect).  
    - **Allocative Efficiency**: Allocating resources to maximize overall population health (e.g., prioritizing vaccinations over rare-disease treatments to benefit more people).  
  - **Role in EE**: Economic evaluation identifies interventions that offer the highest health gains per ringgit spent, promoting both technical and allocative efficiency in healthcare systems.

- **Marginal Analysis**: **Evaluate the incremental cost and effect of a change in resource use**.  
  - Marginal analysis focuses on the additional costs and benefits of small changes in resource allocation, such as scaling up an intervention or modifying its scope.  
  - **Example**: What is the additional cost and benefit of screening 1,000 more people for breast cancer? If the incremental cost is high but the additional cases detected are few, the intervention may not be worth expanding.  
  - **Tool**: The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, defined as:  
    $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{New}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{Comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{New}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{Comparator}}} $$  
    This measures the extra cost per additional unit of health outcome, guiding decisions about whether incremental investments are justified.  
  - **Role in EE**: Marginal analysis ensures that resources are allocated where they generate the most value, fine-tuning decisions to optimize health outcomes.

**Practical Importance**: These principles ensure that economic evaluations are **value-driven** rather than solely cost-driven. By addressing **scarcity**, recognizing **opportunity costs**, promoting **efficiency**, and using **marginal analysis**, evaluations provide a robust framework for prioritizing interventions that deliver the greatest health benefits within limited budgets. For instance, in Malaysia‚Äôs public health system, these principles guide decisions about which interventions to include in the **MyHEALTH formulary** or how to allocate resources for **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)** initiatives.

### üëÄ The Importance of Perspective

**Economic evaluation is influenced by whose costs and benefits are counted.** The choice of **perspective** determines the scope of costs and outcomes included in the analysis, directly affecting the conclusions drawn. By selecting an appropriate perspective, evaluators ensure that the analysis is **relevant** to the stakeholders and **aligned** with the decision-making context.

The table below summarizes the **common perspectives**, their cost inclusions, and their typical uses:

| **Perspective** | **Costs Included** | **Common Use** |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Societal** | All costs (direct, indirect, intangible) | Academics, broad policy |
| **Health System** | Medical costs to providers | HTA bodies, Ministries of Health |
| **Payer** | Reimbursed costs | Insurers, financing agencies |
| **Patient** | Out-of-pocket, lost income | Equity and affordability studies |

- **Societal Perspective**:  
  - **Scope**: The most comprehensive perspective, capturing **all costs and benefits** across society, including **direct medical costs** (e.g., drugs, hospital stays), **direct non-medical costs** (e.g., patient travel), **indirect costs** (e.g., productivity losses), and **intangible costs** (e.g., pain, emotional distress).  
  - **Use**: Ideal for **macro-level policy decisions**, such as those by **global health agencies** or **academics** studying the total societal impact of interventions. For example, evaluating a national vaccination program‚Äôs impact on healthcare costs, productivity, and quality of life.  
  - **Advantages**: Provides a holistic view, ensuring that all impacts are considered.  
  - **Challenges**: Data-intensive and complex, as it requires collecting information across multiple sectors.

- **Health System Perspective**:  
  - **Scope**: Focuses on **direct medical costs** borne by healthcare providers, such as **hospital stays**, **medications**, **staff time**, and **equipment**. Excludes non-medical costs like patient travel or productivity losses.  
  - **Use**: Common in **government budget planning** and **Health Technology Assessments (HTA)** by bodies like Malaysia‚Äôs **MaHTAS**, where the focus is on managing public healthcare budgets.  
  - **Example**: Assessing whether a new cancer drug is cost-effective for inclusion in a public hospital‚Äôs formulary.  
  - **Advantages**: Streamlined and focused, aligning with the priorities of health ministries and providers.  
  - **Limitations**: May overlook broader societal impacts, such as patient financial burdens.

- **Payer Perspective**:  
  - **Scope**: Includes **reimbursed costs** borne by insurers, government schemes, or employers, such as **claims paid** for medical services or medications.  
  - **Use**: Relevant for **insurance schemes** like Malaysia‚Äôs **MySalam** or private insurers evaluating reimbursement policies.  
  - **Example**: Determining whether a new surgical procedure is worth covering based on its cost to the insurer.  
  - **Advantages**: Directly addresses the financial concerns of payers.  
  - **Limitations**: Ignores costs outside the payer‚Äôs scope, such as patient out-of-pocket expenses or societal productivity losses.

- **Patient Perspective**:  
  - **Scope**: Focuses on **out-of-pocket costs** (e.g., co-pays, uncovered treatments) and **indirect costs** (e.g., lost income due to illness or caregiving) borne by individuals.  
  - **Use**: Critical for **equity analyses** and studies on **financial hardship**, such as evaluating the affordability of cancer care in Malaysia.  
  - **Example**: Assessing the financial burden of a new treatment on low-income patients.  
  - **Advantages**: Highlights the patient‚Äôs experience, addressing issues of access and equity.  
  - **Limitations**: Narrow focus may miss broader health system or societal impacts.

**Key Insight**: **The same intervention can lead to different conclusions depending on the perspective**. For example, a costly new drug may appear **cost-effective** from a societal perspective due to productivity gains but **not cost-effective** from a health system perspective due to budget constraints. Similarly, it may be **financially toxic** for patients due to high out-of-pocket costs. This variability underscores the importance of choosing the perspective that aligns with the **policy question**, **stakeholder needs**, and **data availability**.

**Practical Example**:  
Consider a new targeted therapy for breast cancer:  
- **Societal Perspective**: The high drug cost is offset by improved survival and return to work, making it **cost-effective**.  
- **Health System Perspective**: The drug‚Äôs high cost strains the hospital budget, deeming it **not cost-effective**.  
- **Payer Perspective**: High reimbursement costs make it a **low priority** for insurance coverage.  
- **Patient Perspective**: High out-of-pocket costs create **financial toxicity**, limiting access.  

This example illustrates how perspective shapes the evaluation‚Äôs focus and outcomes, emphasizing the need to select the perspective carefully to ensure **relevant** and **actionable** results.

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. Conducting a Full Economic Evaluation

This section outlines the **methodological framework** for conducting a **full economic evaluation**, a systematic process that ensures **structured, transparent, and policy-relevant** comparisons of health interventions. By following a **10-step process**, evaluators can assess the **costs** and **value** of interventions to support **informed decision-making** in resource-constrained health systems. The section also includes a **practical example** to illustrate how these steps are applied in a real-world scenario, enhancing understanding of their application in public health practice.

### üîÑ Overview of the Process

**A well-conducted economic evaluation is structured, transparent, and policy-relevant.** It systematically compares the cost and value of health interventions to support informed decisions, ensuring that limited resources are allocated efficiently to maximize health outcomes. The process involves **10 key steps**, which provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating interventions, from defining the problem to presenting actionable results. This structured approach is critical for ensuring that evaluations are **reproducible**, **credible**, and **aligned with policy priorities**, making them valuable tools for policymakers, health professionals, and researchers in contexts like Malaysia‚Äôs public health system.

### üìã The 10 Key Steps in Economic Evaluation

The following steps outline the **methodological blueprint** for conducting a full economic evaluation, ensuring that all relevant aspects of an intervention are systematically assessed:

1. **Define the Problem and Comparators**  
   - **Clearly state the health issue or policy question.** This step establishes the focus of the evaluation, ensuring that it addresses a specific, well-defined problem.  
   - **Identify the interventions to be compared (e.g., new treatment vs. standard care).** At least two alternatives must be evaluated to provide a comparative analysis, which is the hallmark of economic evaluation.  
   - **Ensure alternatives are clinically relevant and feasible.** The interventions must be practical and applicable in the real-world context to ensure the evaluation‚Äôs relevance.  
   - **Example**: Should the Ministry of Health adopt a new HPV vaccine for boys alongside girls? This question frames the evaluation by comparing the new vaccine program to the existing program for girls, ensuring clinical and policy relevance.

2. **Choose the Perspective**  
   - **Determines which costs and benefits are included.** The perspective shapes the scope of the analysis, focusing on specific stakeholders or society as a whole.  
   - **Common perspectives include:**  
     - **Societal**: All costs and outcomes, including direct, indirect, and intangible costs, providing a comprehensive view.  
     - **Health System**: Direct medical costs, such as those borne by hospitals or clinics, relevant for budget planning.  
     - **Payer**: Reimbursed costs, such as those covered by insurers or government schemes like Malaysia‚Äôs MySalam.  
     - **Patient**: Out-of-pocket costs and productivity losses, critical for equity and affordability analyses.  
   - **Impact**: **Perspective affects the interpretation of value.** For instance, a costly intervention may be cost-effective from a societal perspective but not from a health system perspective due to budget constraints.  
   - **Role in EE**: Selecting the appropriate perspective ensures that the evaluation aligns with the decision-maker‚Äôs goals and stakeholder needs, enhancing its relevance.

3. **Set the Time Horizon**  
   - **Definition**: The duration over which costs and outcomes are measured.  
   - **Requirement**: **Must be long enough to capture meaningful effects.** The time horizon should reflect the intervention‚Äôs expected impact, including short-term and long-term outcomes.  
   - **Variations**:  
     - **Short-term (e.g., 1 year)**: Suitable for acute conditions or interventions with immediate effects, such as treating influenza.  
     - **Long-term (e.g., lifetime for chronic diseases)**: Necessary for conditions like cancer or diabetes, where benefits or costs may emerge over decades.  
   - **Caution**: **A short horizon may miss delayed benefits or costs.** For example, evaluating a cancer treatment over one year may overlook long-term survival gains or recurrence costs, leading to biased conclusions.  
   - **Role in EE**: A well-chosen time horizon ensures that the evaluation captures the full impact of the intervention, avoiding underestimation of its value.

4. **Identify, Measure, and Value Costs**  
   - **Types of Costs**:  
     - **Direct Medical**: Costs incurred by the health system, such as **hospital stays** and **drugs** (e.g., chemotherapy drugs, surgical procedures).  
     - **Direct Non-Medical**: Costs related to accessing care, such as **transport** to healthcare facilities.  
     - **Indirect**: **Lost productivity** due to illness or treatment, such as missed workdays.  
     - **Intangible**: Non-financial costs like **pain** or **emotional distress**, which are hard to quantify but may be considered in societal perspectives.  
   - **Data Sources**: **Real-world data**, **costing studies**, or **tariffs** (e.g., fee schedules, Diagnostic-Related Group tariffs, market prices).  
   - **Importance**: **Accurate cost data is essential for credible economic evaluations.** Inaccurate or incomplete cost estimates can undermine the evaluation‚Äôs validity, leading to flawed decisions.  
   - **Role in EE**: This step ensures that all relevant costs are systematically captured, measured, and valued, providing a robust foundation for comparing interventions.

5. **Identify and Measure Outcomes**  
   - **Types of Outcomes**:  
     - **Natural Units**: Measurable health outcomes like **cases detected** or **life-years gained**, used in Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA).  
     - **Utility-Based**: Metrics like **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** or **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)**, used in Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA).  
     - **Monetary**: Outcomes converted to monetary values (e.g., RM), used in Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA).  
   - **Requirements**: **Outcomes must be meaningful, measurable, and valid.** They should reflect patient and provider priorities, be quantifiable, and be supported by reliable data.  
   - **Impact**: **Outcome choice determines the type of economic evaluation (CEA, CUA, CBA).** For example, a focus on QALYs necessitates a CUA, while monetary outcomes require a CBA.  
   - **Role in EE**: Selecting appropriate outcomes ensures that the evaluation captures the intervention‚Äôs health impact, enabling fair comparisons between alternatives.

6. **Apply Discounting (if needed)**  
   - **Purpose**: **Discounts future costs and outcomes to their present value.** This accounts for the time value of money and health benefits, reflecting societal preferences for immediate gains.  
   - **Common Discount Rates**: $3\%$ to $5\%$, with $3\%$ often used in Malaysia‚Äôs Health Technology Assessments (MaHTAS).  
   - **Rationale**: **Reflects time preference ("value now > value later").** People and health systems value benefits received today more than those received in the future.  
   - **Relevance**: **Especially important for long-term or preventive interventions.** For example, vaccines may have benefits that emerge years later, requiring discounting to compare them fairly with immediate costs.  
   - **Role in EE**: Discounting ensures equitable comparisons across interventions with different timeframes, enhancing the accuracy of long-term evaluations.

7. **Conduct Incremental Analysis**  
   - **Purpose**: **Calculates the additional cost and additional benefit of one intervention over another.** This step focuses on the incremental differences between alternatives, rather than their total costs or outcomes.  
   - **Tool**: **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**:  
     $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_A - \text{Cost}_B}{\text{Effect}_A - \text{Effect}_B} $$  
     - **Numerator**: Incremental cost (e.g., RM).  
     - **Denominator**: Incremental effectiveness (e.g., QALYs, life-years gained).  
   - **Comparison**: **Compare ICER against thresholds** (e.g., willingness-to-pay, GDP per capita, or opportunity cost-based thresholds) to assess cost-effectiveness.  
   - **Benefit**: **Helps determine if the extra cost is worth the extra benefit.** For example, an ICER of RM80,000 per QALY indicates the cost of gaining one additional QALY compared to the alternative.  
   - **Role in EE**: Incremental analysis provides a standardized metric for comparing interventions, guiding decisions about whether additional investments are justified.

8. **Perform Sensitivity Analysis**  
   - **Purpose**: **Tests how results change under uncertainty.** Economic evaluations often rely on estimates or assumptions, and sensitivity analysis assesses the robustness of conclusions.  
   - **Types**:  
     - **One-way**: Vary one parameter at a time (e.g., changing drug cost from RM60,000 to RM40,000).  
     - **Multi-way**: Vary multiple parameters simultaneously (e.g., cost and utility values).  
     - **Probabilistic**: Use Monte Carlo simulations to model uncertainty across multiple parameters.  
   - **Benefits**: **Identifies key drivers and ensures robustness of conclusions.** For example, it reveals whether results are sensitive to changes in drug prices or health outcomes.  
   - **Role in EE**: Sensitivity analysis enhances confidence in findings by testing the impact of uncertainty, making evaluations more reliable for policy decisions.

9. **Use Modelling (if applicable)**  
   - **Purpose**: **For complex or long-term decisions.** Models simulate the progression of health conditions and interventions when direct data are limited.  
   - **Tools**:  
     - **Decision Trees**: For **short-term scenarios**, such as choosing between two treatments for an acute condition.  
     - **Markov Models**: For **chronic or recurring conditions**, like cancer or diabetes, where patients transition between health states over time.  
   - **Function**: **Simulates pathways, probabilities, costs, and outcomes** to bridge data gaps and support extrapolation beyond trial periods.  
   - **Role in EE**: Modelling allows evaluators to estimate long-term costs and outcomes, making it essential for chronic diseases or preventive interventions with delayed effects.

10. **Interpret and Present Results**  
    - **Methods**: Use **cost-effectiveness planes**, **league tables**, or **net benefit** to visualize and compare results.  
    - **Requirements**: **Report clearly, transparently, and with context.** Results should be understandable to stakeholders and include assumptions and limitations.  
    - **Goal**: **Align results with policy priorities or resource constraints.** For example, results should inform whether an intervention fits within a health ministry‚Äôs budget or national health goals.  
    - **Impact**: **Results must inform action, not just analysis.** A well-presented evaluation guides practical decisions, such as adopting a new intervention or reallocating resources.  
    - **Role in EE**: Clear presentation ensures that findings are actionable, supporting evidence-based policy and practice.

### ü¶∑ Practical Example: Mobile Dental Clinic

**Scenario**: The Ministry of Health is considering adding a mobile dental clinic to rural areas to address **limited rural access to dental care**. This example illustrates how the **10 steps** are applied in a real-world public health context, comparing a **mobile dental clinic** to a **fixed subsidy scheme** for dental care access.

The table below outlines the application of each step:

| **Step** | **Example** |
|----------|-------------|
| **Define Problem** | Limited rural access to dental care; compare mobile clinic vs. fixed subsidy scheme |
| **Perspective** | Health system perspective |
| **Time Horizon** | 5 years |
| **Identify Costs** | Mobile van purchase, fuel, salaries vs. per-patient subsidies |
| **Identify Outcomes** | Cavities treated, QALYs gained |
| **Discounting** | Apply $3\%$ per annum |
| **Incremental Analysis** | ICER = RM per cavity treated or RM per QALY |
| **Sensitivity Analysis** | Test variation in staff costs, fuel prices |
| **Modeling** | Use decision tree if data are incomplete |
| **Interpretation** | Present ICER relative to GDP |

- **Define Problem**: The evaluation focuses on addressing **limited rural access to dental care**, comparing a **mobile dental clinic** (a van that travels to rural areas) to a **fixed subsidy scheme** (subsidizing patient visits to existing clinics). This ensures the evaluation addresses a specific, policy-relevant question.  
- **Perspective**: The **health system perspective** is chosen, focusing on costs borne by the Ministry of Health, such as equipment and staff salaries, rather than patient travel costs.  
- **Time Horizon**: A **5-year horizon** is selected to capture the operational costs and health benefits of the mobile clinic, balancing short-term implementation with medium-term outcomes.  
- **Identify Costs**: Costs include **mobile van purchase**, **fuel**, and **salaries** for the clinic, compared to **per-patient subsidies** for the fixed scheme.  
- **Identify Outcomes**: Outcomes are **cavities treated** (a natural unit for CEA) and **QALYs gained** (for CUA), reflecting health improvements from better dental care access.  
- **Discounting**: A **$3\%$ per annum** discount rate is applied to adjust future costs and outcomes to their present value, accounting for time preference.  
- **Incremental Analysis**: The **ICER** is calculated as the cost per cavity treated or per QALY gained, comparing the mobile clinic to the subsidy scheme to determine which is more cost-effective.  
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Tests variations in **staff costs** and **fuel prices** to assess the robustness of the ICER under uncertainty.  
- **Modeling**: A **decision tree** is used if data are incomplete, simulating possible outcomes like treatment success or failure rates.  
- **Interpretation**: The ICER is presented **relative to Malaysia‚Äôs GDP per capita** (e.g., ~RM50,000 per QALY) to determine if the mobile clinic is cost-effective, informing policy decisions.

**Practical Importance**: This example demonstrates how the 10 steps provide a **systematic framework** for evaluating real-world interventions. By applying these steps, the policy-maker can make an **evidence-based decision** about whether a mobile dental clinic offers better value than a subsidy scheme, ensuring efficient use of resources to improve rural health access.

## üí∞ 3. Understanding Costs in Economic Evaluation

Understanding and accurately assessing **costs** is a cornerstone of economic evaluation, as it ensures that the resources consumed by health interventions are systematically captured and compared. This section explores the **definition of cost**, **types of costs**, the **costing process**, and the **approaches to costing**, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating the financial implications of interventions. By mastering these concepts, you will be equipped to conduct **credible** and **policy-relevant** economic evaluations that support **efficient** resource allocation in healthcare systems like Malaysia‚Äôs.

### üìà Definition of Cost

**Cost** is the **value of resources consumed to deliver an intervention or service**. In economic evaluation, costs represent the **economic burden** of implementing a health intervention, encompassing not just financial expenditures but also other resources like time, personnel, and infrastructure.  

- **Core Principle**: **Economic evaluation requires systematic identification, measurement, and valuation of costs** to accurately reflect spending from the relevant perspective. This ensures that the evaluation captures the full scope of resource use, whether from the perspective of the health system, society, payers, or patients.  
- **Importance**: Accurate cost assessment is critical for comparing interventions and determining their **value for money**. Without precise cost data, evaluations risk underestimating or overestimating the financial impact, leading to flawed policy decisions.  
- **Application**: Costs must be tailored to the **chosen perspective** (e.g., societal, health system) to align with the decision-maker‚Äôs goals, ensuring relevance and applicability in contexts like Malaysia‚Äôs public health system.

### üóÇÔ∏è Types of Costs

**Costs are categorized based on their nature and impact**, allowing evaluators to systematically account for all resources consumed by an intervention. The table below summarizes the **four main types of costs** with medical examples, providing clarity on their scope and relevance:

| **Cost Type** | **Description** | **Medical Example** |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Direct Medical** | Costs incurred by the health system/provider | Chemotherapy drugs, oncologist fees, infusion room, lab tests |
| **Direct Non-Medical** | Non-medical expenses due to seeking care | Patient travel to oncology center, parking, accommodation near hospital |
| **Indirect** | Productivity losses due to illness or treatment | Sick leave during chemo cycles, early retirement due to fatigue |
| **Intangible** | Non-financial costs hard to quantify | Anxiety, pain, hair loss stigma, emotional distress |

- **Direct Medical Costs**: These are expenses directly related to healthcare delivery, borne by the health system or provider.  
  - **Examples**: Costs of **chemotherapy drugs**, **oncologist fees**, **infusion room usage**, and **lab tests** for cancer treatment.  
  - **Relevance**: Critical for **health system** or **provider perspectives**, as they reflect the direct financial burden on healthcare facilities.  
- **Direct Non-Medical Costs**: These are non-healthcare expenses incurred by patients or families to access care.  
  - **Examples**: **Patient travel** to an oncology center, **parking fees**, or **accommodation costs** for treatment far from home.  
  - **Relevance**: Included in **societal** or **patient perspectives**, as they capture the broader economic impact on individuals seeking care.  
- **Indirect Costs**: These reflect productivity losses due to illness or treatment, affecting patients or caregivers.  
  - **Examples**: **Sick leave** during chemotherapy cycles or **early retirement** due to treatment-related fatigue.  
  - **Relevance**: Important for **societal** or **patient perspectives**, as they account for economic impacts outside the healthcare system.  
- **Intangible Costs**: These are non-financial costs that are difficult to quantify, such as emotional or psychological impacts.  
  - **Examples**: **Anxiety**, **pain**, **hair loss stigma**, or **emotional distress** from cancer treatment.  
  - **Relevance**: Typically considered in **societal perspectives** but rarely monetized due to measurement challenges.  

**Key Insight**: The types of costs included depend on the **perspective** of the evaluation. For example, a **health system perspective** focuses solely on direct medical costs, while a **societal perspective** encompasses all cost types, ensuring a comprehensive assessment.

### üîç The Costing Process: 3 Steps

The costing process is a **systematic approach** to capturing the resources consumed by an intervention, ensuring accuracy and relevance in economic evaluations. It involves **three key steps**: **identification**, **measurement**, and **valuation**, each critical for producing credible cost estimates.

1. **Identification**  
   - **Question**: **What resources are used?**  
   - **Action**: **List all relevant resource items for the intervention and comparator.** This step involves identifying every resource consumed, from medical supplies to patient travel, ensuring no relevant costs are overlooked.  
   - **Example**: For a chemotherapy program, resources include the **number of chemo sessions**, **blood tests**, and **clinic visits**. Both the intervention (e.g., new drug) and comparator (e.g., standard chemo) must be considered to ensure a comprehensive comparison.  
   - **Role in EE**: Identification sets the scope of the cost analysis, aligning it with the evaluation‚Äôs perspective and objectives.

2. **Measurement**  
   - **Question**: **How much was used?**  
   - **Action**: **Quantify resource use** (e.g., number of visits, days hospitalized) to determine the volume of resources consumed.  
   - **Data Sources**: **Patient records**, **surveys**, or **administrative databases** provide reliable data for quantifying resource use.  
   - **Example**: A chemotherapy program might involve **6 cycles of chemo** and **12 blood tests** per patient, based on clinical records or trial data.  
   - **Role in EE**: Measurement ensures that the quantity of resources is accurately captured, providing a foundation for valuation.

3. **Valuation**  
   - **Action**: **Assign a monetary value to each resource unit.** This step converts resource use into monetary terms, enabling cost comparisons.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - RM1,500 per chemo cycle.  
     - RM80 per lab test.  
     - RM50 per outpatient visit.  
   - **Sources**: **Standard prices** such as **fee schedules**, **Diagnostic-Related Group (DRG) tariffs**, **market prices**, or **published cost studies** ensure consistency and reliability.  
   - **Role in EE**: Valuation translates resource use into financial terms, allowing evaluators to calculate total costs and compare interventions accurately.

**Practical Importance**: The **three-step costing process** ensures that costs are **systematically identified, measured, and valued**, providing a robust foundation for economic evaluations. For example, in Malaysia‚Äôs public health system, this process is used to estimate the costs of interventions like cancer screening programs, ensuring that budget allocations are based on accurate and transparent data.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Micro-Costing vs. Gross-Costing

The approach to costing affects the **precision** and **effort** required in an economic evaluation. **Micro-costing** and **gross-costing** represent two distinct methods, each suited to different contexts. The table below compares these approaches:

| **Approach** | **Description** | **Use When...** |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Micro-Costing** | Itemize and value each resource in detail | High precision needed (e.g., alongside clinical trials) |
| **Gross-Costing** | Use average cost per service unit | Budget planning, secondary data |

- **Micro-Costing**:  
  - **Description**: Involves **itemizing and valuing each resource in detail**, such as the cost of individual drugs, staff time per procedure, or equipment use per patient.  
  - **Use When**: **High precision is needed**, such as in **clinical trials** where detailed cost data are collected alongside efficacy data.  
  - **Advantages**: Provides **high accuracy** and granularity, capturing the true cost of complex interventions.  
  - **Challenges**: **Time-consuming** and resource-intensive, requiring extensive data collection and analysis.  
  - **Example**: Calculating the exact cost of a chemotherapy regimen by itemizing drug doses, infusion time, and lab tests.

- **Gross-Costing**:  
  - **Description**: Uses **average cost per service unit**, such as the cost per hospital day or per outpatient visit, without breaking down individual components.  
  - **Use When**: Suitable for **budget planning** or when relying on **secondary data**, such as national cost databases.  
  - **Advantages**: **Quicker** and less resource-intensive, making it practical for large-scale or preliminary analyses.  
  - **Challenges**: **Less detailed**, potentially missing variations in resource use across patients or settings.  
  - **Example**: Using an average cost of RM2,000 per chemotherapy session based on hospital billing data.

**Key Insight**: **Micro-costing is more precise but time-consuming, while gross-costing is quicker but less detailed.** The choice between these approaches depends on the evaluation‚Äôs goals, available data, and resource constraints. For instance, Malaysia‚Äôs **MaHTAS** might use micro-costing for detailed HTA studies but gross-costing for rapid budget estimates.

### ü©∫ Example: Costing for HER2+ Breast Cancer

**Policy Question**: **Is Drug A (new monoclonal antibody) more cost-effective than Drug B (standard chemo) for HER2+ breast cancer?** This example illustrates how the costing process is applied in a real-world health evaluation, highlighting the importance of perspective and accuracy.

**Costs to Consider**:  
- **Drug Acquisition**: RM5,000 per cycle for Drug A vs. RM1,200 per cycle for Drug B.  
- **Pre-Medication & Monitoring Labs**: Costs for drugs to manage side effects and lab tests to monitor patient health.  
- **Management of Side Effects**: Costs for treating adverse events, such as **febrile neutropenia admission** due to chemotherapy toxicity.  
- **Patient Travel and Lost Income**: Included if using a **societal** or **patient perspective**, capturing costs like transportation to treatment centers or lost wages due to treatment time.  

**Key Principle**: **Accurate costing requires understanding what resources are used, how much, at what price, and from whose perspective.**  
- **What Resources**: Identify all relevant resources, such as drugs, lab tests, and hospital visits for both Drug A and Drug B.  
- **How Much**: Measure resource use, e.g., 6 cycles of Drug A vs. 8 cycles of Drug B, based on clinical protocols.  
- **At What Price**: Assign monetary values using standard sources, e.g., RM5,000 per cycle for Drug A based on market prices.  
- **Whose Perspective**: The choice of perspective (e.g., health system vs. societal) determines which costs are included. For example, a **health system perspective** excludes travel and lost income, while a **societal perspective** includes them.  

**Practical Importance**: This example demonstrates how the costing process ensures **transparency** and **accuracy** in economic evaluations. By systematically assessing costs for Drug A and Drug B, evaluators can determine which intervention offers better value, informing decisions about inclusion in Malaysia‚Äôs **formulary** or other funding priorities.

## üë• 4. Perspective in Economic Evaluation

The **perspective** of an economic evaluation is a pivotal factor that shapes its scope, focus, and conclusions. By defining **whose costs and benefits** are considered, perspective determines which costs and outcomes are included, ensuring the evaluation is tailored to the needs of specific stakeholders. This section explores the **definition of perspective**, **common perspectives**, their **applications**, and their **implications**, using a practical example to illustrate how perspective influences the evaluation of health interventions. Understanding perspective is essential for producing **relevant**, **actionable**, and **context-specific** results in economic evaluations, particularly in settings like Malaysia‚Äôs diverse healthcare system.

### üéØ What is Perspective?

**Perspective defines whose costs and benefits are counted in an economic evaluation.** It establishes the **lens** through which the intervention‚Äôs economic and health impacts are assessed, directly influencing the scope of the analysis and the relevance of its findings to stakeholders.

- **Core Role**: Perspective determines the **scope of analysis** by specifying which costs (e.g., medical, non-medical, or productivity losses) and benefits (e.g., health gains, financial savings) are included. For example, a health system perspective focuses on provider costs, while a societal perspective captures all costs, including those borne by patients.  
- **Impact on Findings**: The **relevance of findings** to stakeholders‚Äîsuch as policymakers, insurers, or patients‚Äîdepends on the chosen perspective. An evaluation from a patient perspective highlights affordability, while one from a health system perspective prioritizes budget efficiency.  
- **Importance**: Selecting the appropriate perspective ensures that the evaluation aligns with the **decision-making context**, such as national health policy, insurance reimbursement, or equity analysis. Misaligned perspectives can lead to misleading conclusions, undermining the evaluation‚Äôs utility.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, perspective choice is critical for evaluations conducted by bodies like **MaHTAS** (Health Technology Assessment) or programs like **MySalam**, ensuring that results address the specific needs of the health system, payers, or patients.

### üìä Common Perspectives

The choice of perspective varies based on the stakeholders involved and the evaluation‚Äôs goals. The table below outlines the **four common perspectives**, their **cost inclusions**, and their **typical users**, providing a clear framework for selecting the appropriate perspective:

| **Perspective** | **Costs Included** | **Commonly Used By** |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Societal** | All costs (direct, indirect, intangible) | Academics, global health agencies |
| **Health System/Provider** | Direct medical costs only | Ministries of Health, HTA bodies |
| **Payer** | Reimbursed/claimable medical expenses | Insurance schemes, MySalam, employers |
| **Patient** | Out-of-pocket costs, lost income | Advocacy groups, equity researchers |

- **Societal Perspective**:  
  - **Scope**: The most comprehensive perspective, capturing **all costs and benefits**, including **direct medical costs** (e.g., drugs, hospital stays), **direct non-medical costs** (e.g., patient travel), **indirect costs** (e.g., lost productivity), and **intangible costs** (e.g., pain, emotional distress).  
  - **Commonly Used By**: **Academics** and **global health agencies** (e.g., WHO, OECD) for broad policy analyses that assess the total societal impact of interventions.  
  - **Example**: Evaluating a national vaccination program‚Äôs impact on healthcare costs, workforce productivity, and patient well-being.  
  - **Advantages**: Provides a **holistic view**, capturing the full economic and social impact of an intervention.  
  - **Challenges**: **Data-intensive**, requiring extensive data collection across multiple sectors, which may be impractical in resource-limited settings.

- **Health System/Provider Perspective**:  
  - **Scope**: Focuses on **direct medical costs only**, such as costs incurred by hospitals or clinics for **medications**, **staff time**, **equipment**, or **inpatient care**. Excludes patient-borne costs or societal impacts.  
  - **Commonly Used By**: **Ministries of Health** and **HTA bodies** (e.g., Malaysia‚Äôs MaHTAS) for budget planning and resource allocation within public healthcare systems.  
  - **Example**: Assessing the cost of a new cancer drug for inclusion in a public hospital‚Äôs formulary.  
  - **Advantages**: **Streamlined and focused**, aligning with the financial constraints of healthcare providers.  
  - **Challenges**: May overlook broader societal impacts, such as patient financial burdens or productivity losses.

- **Payer Perspective**:  
  - **Scope**: Includes **reimbursed or claimable medical expenses**, such as costs covered by insurance schemes, government programs, or employers for treatments or services.  
  - **Commonly Used By**: **Insurance schemes** (e.g., Malaysia‚Äôs MySalam) and **employers** managing health benefits.  
  - **Example**: Evaluating whether a new surgical procedure is worth covering based on reimbursement costs.  
  - **Advantages**: Directly addresses the financial concerns of payers, ensuring alignment with insurance or funding priorities.  
  - **Challenges**: Ignores costs outside the payer‚Äôs scope, such as patient out-of-pocket expenses or societal productivity losses.

- **Patient Perspective**:  
  - **Scope**: Focuses on **out-of-pocket costs** (e.g., co-pays, uncovered treatments) and **lost income** due to illness or treatment, emphasizing the financial burden on individuals.  
  - **Commonly Used By**: **Advocacy groups** and **equity researchers** studying access and affordability issues.  
  - **Example**: Assessing the financial impact of cancer treatment on low-income patients in Malaysia.  
  - **Advantages**: Highlights **equity** and **affordability**, addressing the patient‚Äôs experience and potential financial hardship.  
  - **Challenges**: Narrow focus may miss broader health system or societal impacts.

**Practical Importance**: The choice of perspective ensures that the evaluation is **tailored to the stakeholder‚Äôs needs**, such as budget planning for health ministries or affordability for patients. In Malaysia, for instance, a **health system perspective** is often used for **MaHTAS evaluations**, while a **patient perspective** is critical for addressing **health equity** in programs like Peka B40.

### üíä Example: HER2+ Breast Cancer Treatment

This example illustrates how different perspectives affect the costs considered in evaluating treatments for **HER2+ breast cancer**, highlighting the practical implications of perspective choice. The table below shows which **cost items** are included under each perspective:

| **Cost Item** | **Included in...** |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Drug price (RM per cycle) | All perspectives |
| Blood tests, infusion costs | Provider, Payer, Societal |
| Travel to cancer center | Patient, Societal |
| Lost income from work | Patient, Societal |

- **Drug Price (RM per cycle)**: Included in **all perspectives**, as it represents a core cost of treatment, whether borne by the health system, payer, patient (via co-pays), or society.  
- **Blood Tests, Infusion Costs**: Included in **Provider**, **Payer**, and **Societal** perspectives, as these are medical costs incurred by hospitals, reimbursed by insurers, or aggregated in societal analyses.  
- **Travel to Cancer Center**: Included in **Patient** and **Societal** perspectives, as it represents a non-medical cost borne by patients accessing treatment.  
- **Lost Income from Work**: Included in **Patient** and **Societal** perspectives, capturing productivity losses due to treatment-related absences.  

**Application**: For a HER2+ breast cancer treatment, a **health system perspective** would focus on drug and infusion costs, while a **patient perspective** would emphasize travel and income losses, reflecting different priorities. This example underscores the need to align the perspective with the evaluation‚Äôs goals, such as budgeting or equity analysis.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Implications: Same Intervention, Different Conclusions

**Comparing Drug A (targeted therapy) vs. Drug B (standard chemotherapy)** illustrates how perspective shapes the conclusions of an economic evaluation. The table below summarizes the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** interpretations for each perspective:

| **Perspective** | **ICER Interpretation** |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| **Societal** | High drug cost offset by return to work ‚Üí **Cost-effective** |
| **Health System** | Costly intervention without enough budget impact benefit ‚Üí **Not cost-effective** |
| **Patient** | High out-of-pocket costs ‚Üí **Financially toxic** |
| **Payer** | High reimbursement claim burden ‚Üí **Low priority** |

- **Societal Perspective**: **High drug cost offset by return to work ‚Üí Cost-effective.** The high cost of Drug A (targeted therapy) is justified by benefits like improved survival and productivity gains, which reduce societal costs (e.g., less caregiver burden or lost income). This perspective often favors interventions with broad societal benefits.  
- **Health System Perspective**: **Costly intervention without enough budget impact benefit ‚Üí Not cost-effective.** Drug A‚Äôs high cost strains hospital budgets, and the health system may not see sufficient financial returns within its scope, making it less viable for public funding.  
- **Patient Perspective**: **High out-of-pocket costs ‚Üí Financially toxic.** Even with subsidies, Drug A may require significant patient co-pays, creating financial hardship, especially for low-income patients in Malaysia.  
- **Payer Perspective**: **High reimbursement claim burden ‚Üí Low priority.** The high cost of Drug A leads to substantial claims for insurers, making it less attractive for reimbursement compared to cheaper alternatives like Drug B.

**Key Insight**: **The choice of perspective can lead to different conclusions for the same intervention.** For example, Drug A may be deemed **cost-effective** from a societal perspective due to long-term benefits but **not cost-effective** from a health system perspective due to immediate budget constraints. This variability highlights the importance of selecting a perspective that aligns with the **policy question** (e.g., national formulary inclusion) and **stakeholder needs** (e.g., patients, insurers).

**Practical Importance**: In Malaysia‚Äôs context, choosing the right perspective is critical for evaluations conducted by **MaHTAS** (for Sexually Transmitted Diseases) or other health authorities. A **societal perspective** might be used for broad policy decisions, while a **patient perspective** could inform programs like **Peka B40** to address equity. The choice ensures that evaluations are **relevant** and **actionable**, guiding decisions that balance efficiency, equity, and affordability.

## üìä 5. Outcomes in Economic Evaluation

**Outcomes** are the heart of economic evaluation, capturing the **health benefits** or **consequences** of interventions. This section explores the **definition of outcomes**, the **types of outcome measures**, their **applications** in different evaluation types, the **concept of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**, and **methods for measuring utilities**. By understanding how outcomes are selected and measured, you will be equipped to assess the **value** of health interventions accurately, ensuring evaluations are **meaningful** and **relevant** to stakeholders in contexts like Malaysia‚Äôs public health system.

### üåü What are Outcomes?

**Outcomes represent the consequences of an intervention on health.** They quantify the **health benefits** achieved, such as improved survival, reduced disease burden, or enhanced quality of life, and are critical for comparing interventions in economic evaluations.  

- **Core Principle**: Outcomes are **measured differently depending on the type of economic evaluation**. The choice of outcome measure‚Äîwhether natural units, utility-based metrics, or monetary values‚Äîdetermines the evaluation type (e.g., CEA, CUA, CBA) and aligns with the evaluation‚Äôs objectives.  
- **Importance**: Outcomes provide the **benefit side** of the cost-effectiveness equation, enabling decision-makers to assess whether an intervention‚Äôs health gains justify its costs.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, outcomes are used to evaluate interventions like cancer treatments or vaccination programs, ensuring that resources are allocated to interventions that maximize health impact.

### üìè Types of Outcome Measures

The choice of outcome measure is tied to the **perspective** and **evaluation type**, ensuring that the analysis captures the most relevant health impacts. The table below maps **perspectives** to **outcome types** and their use in economic evaluations:

| **Perspective** | **Costs Included** | **Outcome Type** | **Used In** |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Societal** | All costs (direct, indirect, intangible) | Natural units | CEA |
| **Health System/Provider** | Direct medical costs only | Utility-based | CUA |
| **Payer** | Reimbursed/claimable medical expenses | Monetary | CBA |

- **Natural Units (CEA)**: Used in **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**, these are measurable health outcomes like **life-years gained**, **cases detected**, or **hospitalizations avoided**.  
  - **Example**: A breast cancer screening program might measure outcomes as **cases detected**, focusing on clinical effectiveness.  
  - **Relevance**: Ideal for evaluations where **quantity of health** (e.g., survival) is the primary concern, often used in **societal perspectives** to capture broad health impacts.  
- **Utility-Based (CUA)**: Used in **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)**, these metrics, such as **QALYs** or **DALYs**, combine **quantity** and **quality of life**.  
  - **Example**: A cancer treatment‚Äôs impact might be measured in **QALYs**, accounting for both survival and side effects.  
  - **Relevance**: Common in **health system/provider perspectives**, especially for Health Technology Assessments (e.g., Malaysia‚Äôs MaHTAS), as they capture patient well-being.  
- **Monetary (CBA)**: Used in **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**, outcomes are converted to **monetary values** (e.g., RM), such as productivity gains or healthcare cost savings.  
  - **Example**: A workplace wellness program might measure outcomes as **RM value of reduced sick leave**.  
  - **Relevance**: Used in **payer perspectives** or cross-sector analyses, allowing comparisons with non-health interventions but raising ethical challenges in monetizing health.

**Practical Importance**: The choice of outcome measure ensures that the evaluation aligns with the **decision context** and **stakeholder needs**, such as clinical effectiveness for providers or financial returns for payers.

### ü©∫ Example: Breast Cancer Outcomes

This example illustrates how different outcome measures are applied when **comparing Drug A (targeted therapy) vs. Drug B (standard chemotherapy)** for HER2+ breast cancer, highlighting their relevance to specific evaluation types:

| **Evaluation** | **Outcome Used** | **Why It Matters** |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **CEA** | Life-years gained | Drug A improves survival by 8 months |
| **CUA** | QALYs | Drug A improves survival with fewer side effects, enhancing QoL |
| **CBA** | RM value of productivity | Drug A allows earlier return to work |

- **CEA (Life-Years Gained)**:  
  - **Outcome**: **Drug A improves survival by 8 months** compared to Drug B.  
  - **Why It Matters**: This outcome focuses on **quantity of life**, making it suitable for CEA, where the goal is to compare survival gains relative to costs. For example, policymakers might use this to assess whether Drug A‚Äôs survival benefit justifies its higher cost.  
- **CUA (QALYs)**:  
  - **Outcome**: **Drug A improves survival with fewer side effects, enhancing quality of life (QoL).**  
  - **Why It Matters**: QALYs capture both **survival** and **well-being**, making CUA ideal for interventions where side effects significantly impact patients. In Malaysia, CUA is often used by **MaHTAS** to evaluate treatments like targeted therapies.  
- **CBA (RM Value of Productivity)**:  
  - **Outcome**: **Drug A allows earlier return to work**, reducing productivity losses.  
  - **Why It Matters**: By converting outcomes to monetary values, CBA enables comparisons across sectors (e.g., health vs. education), but monetizing health benefits can be controversial.

**Application**: This example shows how outcome choice shapes the evaluation‚Äôs focus. For instance, a **health system perspective** might prioritize QALYs for CUA, while a **societal perspective** might include productivity gains for CBA, ensuring relevance to the evaluation‚Äôs goals.

### üïí What is a QALY? (Quality-Adjusted Life Year)

**Definition**: A **Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY)** **combines length of life and quality of life** on a scale from $0$ (death) to $1$ (perfect health). It is a widely used metric in **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)** to assess interventions where quality of life is a significant factor.

- **Examples**:  
  - **1 year of life at full health = $1$ QALY.** This represents a year lived in perfect health, with no impairments.  
  - **1 year of life with side effects (utility = $0.6$) = $0.6$ QALYs.** For example, a year lived with chemotherapy-related side effects reduces the QALY value based on the impact on quality of life.  
- **Use**: **CUA is useful when quality of life is significantly affected** (e.g., chemotherapy vs. targeted therapy). QALYs allow evaluators to balance survival gains with side effects, making them ideal for assessing treatments with significant impacts on patient well-being, such as cancer therapies in Malaysia‚Äôs public health system.  
- **Importance**: QALYs provide a **standardized measure** that integrates both **quantity** and **quality of life**, enabling fair comparisons across interventions. They are widely used in **Health Technology Assessments** globally and by Malaysia‚Äôs **MaHTAS**.

### üìã How are Utilities Measured?

**Utilities** reflect the **quality of life** associated with specific health states, forming the basis for calculating QALYs. They are measured on a scale from $0$ (death) to $1$ (perfect health) and are derived using various methods. The table below summarizes **common measurement methods**:

| **Method** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| **EQ-5D** | Standardized tool for health states |
| **Time Trade-Off** | Time willing to trade for better health |
| **Standard Gamble** | Risk willing to accept for full health |

- **EQ-5D**:  
  - A **standardized tool** that assesses health states across five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression).  
  - **Example**: A patient with cancer might report moderate pain and anxiety, yielding a utility score of $0.7$.  
  - **Relevance**: Widely used due to its simplicity and validated scoring system, often applied in clinical trials and population studies.  
- **Time Trade-Off (TTO)**:  
  - Measures the **time a patient is willing to trade** for better health. For example, a patient might prefer 8 years in perfect health over 10 years with chronic pain.  
  - **Example**: If a patient trades 2 years of a 10-year lifespan for perfect health, the utility is $8/10 = 0.8$.  
  - **Relevance**: Captures patient preferences for quality over quantity of life, useful for chronic conditions.  
- **Standard Gamble (SG)**:  
  - Measures the **risk a patient is willing to accept** for full health. For example, a patient might accept a 20% risk of death for a chance at perfect health.  
  - **Example**: If a patient accepts a 20% risk, the utility is $1 - 0.2 = 0.8$.  
  - **Relevance**: Reflects patient risk preferences, often used in high-stakes health decisions.  

**Note**: **Studies may use published utility weights or collect new data from patients.**  
- **Published Utility Weights**: Derived from large-scale studies (e.g., EQ-5D databases) and applied to similar populations, ensuring consistency.  
- **New Data Collection**: Involves surveying patients directly to capture context-specific utilities, particularly for unique interventions or populations.  

**Practical Importance**: Accurate utility measurement ensures that QALYs reflect the true impact of interventions on patient well-being, making CUAs reliable for decision-making in settings like Malaysia‚Äôs health system.

## ‚è∞ 6. Timing and Discounting

The **timing** of costs and outcomes in economic evaluations significantly influences their assessment, as the value of future benefits and costs differs from those occurring immediately. This section explores **why timing matters**, the **concept of discounting**, **standard discount rates**, the **definition of time horizon**, and their **implications** for evaluating health interventions. By understanding these concepts, you will be equipped to ensure **fair comparisons** between interventions with varying timeframes, making evaluations **robust** and **policy-relevant**, particularly in contexts like Malaysia‚Äôs healthcare system.

### üï∞Ô∏è Why Does Timing Matter?

**Future costs and outcomes are worth less than immediate ones due to time preference in economics.** This reflects the fundamental economic principle that people and health systems value benefits received now more than those in the future.

- **Rationale**: **People value benefits now more than later.** This **time preference** arises because immediate benefits provide instant utility, while future benefits are uncertain and less impactful in present decision-making. For example, a patient may prefer immediate pain relief over a treatment that improves health years later.  
- **Importance**: Timing affects how costs and outcomes are valued in economic evaluations. Interventions with delayed benefits, such as preventive programs, require careful adjustment to compare fairly with those offering immediate results.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, timing is critical when evaluating interventions like **vaccination programs**, where costs are incurred upfront but benefits (e.g., disease prevention) occur years later, necessitating methods like discounting to ensure equitable assessments.

### üí∏ What is Discounting?

**Definition**: **A method to adjust future costs and outcomes to their present value.** Discounting accounts for time preference by reducing the value of future costs and benefits to reflect their worth in today‚Äôs terms.

- **Application**: **Applied when the time horizon exceeds 1 year.** Discounting is essential for evaluations spanning multiple years, as it ensures that long-term costs and outcomes are comparable to immediate ones.  
- **Purpose**: **Ensures fair comparison between interventions with different timing of costs and benefits.** For example, a cancer treatment with high upfront costs but long-term survival gains must be discounted to compare fairly with a cheaper, short-term alternative.  
- **Importance**: Discounting prevents overvaluing future benefits, making evaluations more accurate and relevant for decision-making in resource-constrained settings like Malaysia‚Äôs public health system.

### üìâ Standard Discount Rates

The choice of discount rate is critical in economic evaluations, as it determines how much future values are reduced. The table below summarizes **common discount rates** used in different contexts:

| **Context**                             | **Common Rate**                              |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **High-income settings (e.g., UK, US)** | $3\%$ annually                               |
| **LMIC guidelines/WHO**                 | $3\% - 5\%$                                  |
| **Malaysian HTA (MaHTAS)**              | Often uses $3\%$ for both costs and benefits |

- **High-income settings (e.g., UK, US)**: Typically use a **$3\%$ annual discount rate**, reflecting stable economic conditions and established guidelines (e.g., NICE in the UK).  
- **LMIC guidelines/WHO**: Recommend a range of **$3\% - 5\%$**, accounting for economic variability in low- and middle-income countries.  
- **Malaysian HTA (MaHTAS)**: **Often uses $3\%$ for both costs and benefits**, aligning with international standards while reflecting Malaysia‚Äôs economic context.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, a $3\%$ discount rate is commonly applied in **Health Technology Assessments (HTA)** to evaluate interventions like new drugs or screening programs, ensuring consistency and comparability.

### ü©∫ Example: Breast Cancer Case

This example illustrates the impact of **discounting** on a breast cancer treatment evaluation, comparing outcomes **without and with a $3\%$ discount rate**. The table below summarizes the results:

| **Metric** | **Without Discounting** | **With Discounting ($3\%$)** |
|------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Survival Gain** | $0.8$ QALYs | $\approx 0.76$ QALYs |
| **Future Productivity Gains** | RM20,000 | $\approx$ RM18,500 |

- **Survival Gain**:  
  - **Without Discounting**: A treatment yields **$0.8$ QALYs**, representing 8 months of quality-adjusted life without adjustment.  
  - **With Discounting ($3\%$)**: The present value is reduced to **$\approx 0.76$ QALYs**, reflecting the lower value of future health benefits.  
- **Future Productivity Gains**:  
  - **Without Discounting**: Future productivity gains are valued at **RM20,000**, assuming no time preference.  
  - **With Discounting ($3\%$)**: The present value is reduced to **$\approx$ RM18,500**, accounting for the decreased value of future financial benefits.  
- **Key Insight**: **Discounting reduces both future health and financial benefits.** This adjustment ensures that long-term outcomes are fairly compared to immediate ones, preventing overestimation of future gains.

**Application**: In Malaysia, discounting is critical for evaluating interventions like **targeted cancer therapies**, where high upfront costs are weighed against long-term survival and productivity gains, ensuring accurate cost-effectiveness assessments.

### ‚è≥ What is a Time Horizon?

**Definition**: The **length of time over which costs and outcomes are measured in an evaluation.** The time horizon determines the scope of the analysis, ensuring that all relevant costs and benefits are captured.

- **Choosing an Appropriate Time Horizon**: The table below outlines recommended time horizons for different scenarios:

| **Scenario** | **Recommended Horizon** |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| **Acute illness (e.g., influenza)** | 1 year or less |
| **Chronic disease (e.g., cancer, diabetes)** | Lifetime or long-term (10‚Äì20 years) |
| **Preventive intervention** | Until key outcomes occur (e.g., cancer incidence avoided) |

- **Acute Illness (e.g., influenza)**: A **1-year or less** horizon is sufficient, as costs and outcomes occur rapidly. For example, evaluating a flu treatment focuses on immediate recovery and costs.  
- **Chronic Disease (e.g., cancer, diabetes)**: A **lifetime or long-term (10‚Äì20 years)** horizon is needed to capture ongoing costs (e.g., treatment, monitoring) and benefits (e.g., survival, quality of life).  
- **Preventive Intervention**: The horizon should extend **until key outcomes occur**, such as cancer incidence avoided in a vaccination program, which may require decades to fully manifest.  
- **Importance**: The time horizon must be **long enough to capture meaningful effects**, ensuring that the evaluation reflects the intervention‚Äôs full impact.

### ü©∫ Implications for Breast Cancer Evaluation

The choice of time horizon significantly affects the evaluation of a breast cancer treatment, as illustrated below:

- **Short Horizon (1‚Äì2 years)**: **Captures only drug costs, not full survival gains.** A short horizon focuses on immediate costs (e.g., drug administration) but misses long-term benefits like extended survival or reduced recurrence, leading to an incomplete assessment.  
- **Lifetime Horizon**: **Captures long-term benefits like reduced recurrence, survival, and return to work.** A longer horizon accounts for the full impact of the treatment, such as improved quality of life and productivity gains, providing a more comprehensive evaluation.  
- **Caution**: **Underestimating the time horizon can bias against long-term, high-impact interventions like Drug A.** For example, a 1-year horizon for a targeted therapy may show high costs without capturing its survival benefits, unfairly deeming it not cost-effective.  

**Practical Importance**: In Malaysia‚Äôs context, choosing an appropriate time horizon is critical for evaluating **chronic disease treatments** or **preventive programs**. A lifetime horizon ensures that interventions like cancer therapies or HPV vaccinations are fairly assessed, capturing their long-term value for health systems like **MaHTAS** or programs like **Peka B40**.

## üìà 7. Incremental Analysis and ICER

**Incremental analysis** is a cornerstone of economic evaluation, enabling decision-makers to compare the **additional costs** and **benefits** of one health intervention over another. This section explores the **definition of incremental analysis**, the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, **thresholds** for interpreting cost-effectiveness, and their **application** in real-world scenarios, such as evaluating cancer treatments in Malaysia. By mastering these concepts, you will be equipped to assess whether the additional costs of an intervention are justified by its health benefits, supporting **evidence-based** and **policy-relevant** decisions in resource-constrained health systems.

### üîç What is Incremental Analysis?

**Definition**: **Incremental analysis compares the additional cost and additional benefit of one intervention versus another.** It focuses on the **differences** in costs and outcomes between two options, rather than their total values, to determine the value of adopting a new intervention.

- **Question Answered**: **"How much more are we paying for each additional unit of outcome?"** This question is critical for understanding whether the extra cost of a new intervention is worth the additional health benefit it provides.  
- **Importance**: Incremental analysis ensures that decision-makers focus on the **incremental value** of an intervention, avoiding misleading conclusions based on total costs or outcomes alone.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, incremental analysis is used to evaluate interventions like new cancer drugs or vaccination programs, helping bodies like **MaHTAS** decide whether to include them in public health systems.

### üìù ICER Formula

The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** is the key metric in incremental analysis, quantifying the cost per additional unit of health outcome. It is calculated as:

$$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{New}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{Comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{New}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{Comparator}}} $$

- **Numerator**: **Incremental cost (RM)**, representing the additional cost of the new intervention compared to the comparator.  
- **Denominator**: **Incremental effectiveness** (e.g., QALYs, life-years gained), representing the additional health benefit.  
- **Purpose**: The ICER provides a standardized measure to compare the cost-effectiveness of interventions, enabling decision-makers to assess whether the extra cost is justified by the extra benefit.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia‚Äôs health system, ICERs are used to evaluate interventions for inclusion in the **MyHEALTH formulary**, ensuring resources are allocated efficiently.

### ü©∫ Example: HER2+ Breast Cancer Drug Evaluation

This example illustrates how incremental analysis and ICER are applied to evaluate **Drug A (targeted therapy)** versus **Drug B (standard chemotherapy)** for HER2+ breast cancer. The table below presents the data:

| **Option** | **Cost (RM)** | **QALYs Gained** |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Drug B (Standard)** | 20,000 | 1.5 |
| **Drug A (Targeted)** | 60,000 | 2.0 |

**ICER Calculation**:

$$ \text{ICER} = \frac{60,000 - 20,000}{2.0 - 1.5} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = 80,000 \, \text{RM per QALY} $$

- **Incremental Cost**: RM60,000 - RM20,000 = **RM40,000**.  
- **Incremental Effectiveness**: 2.0 - 1.5 = **0.5 QALYs**.  
- **Result**: The ICER of **80,000 RM per QALY** indicates that adopting Drug A costs an additional RM80,000 for each additional QALY gained compared to Drug B.  
- **Application**: This ICER helps policymakers determine whether Drug A‚Äôs additional benefits justify its higher cost, guiding decisions about its inclusion in Malaysia‚Äôs public health system.

### ü§î How to Interpret the ICER?

Interpreting the ICER involves comparing it to a **threshold** to determine cost-effectiveness:

- **If ICER < threshold**: The intervention is **cost-effective**, meaning the additional cost is justified by the health benefits.  
- **If ICER > threshold**: It may **not be cost-effective**, depending on the context, such as budget constraints or intervention priority.  
- **Threshold Determinants**:  
  - **National Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) thresholds**: Reflect how much a health system is willing to pay for a health gain, often based on policy priorities.  
  - **GDP-based benchmarks**: Use economic indicators like GDP per capita to set informal thresholds.  
  - **Opportunity cost in the health system**: Consider what health benefits are forgone when resources are allocated to the new intervention.  

**Importance**: The ICER‚Äôs interpretation depends on the **context** and **threshold**, ensuring that decisions align with health system goals and resource availability.

### üí∞ Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) Threshold

**Definition**: The **WTP threshold reflects how much a health system or society is willing to pay for an additional unit of health gain (e.g., 1 QALY)**.  

- **Basis**: Determined by **political**, **ethical**, and **budgetary considerations**, varying across countries and health systems.  
- **Example**: The UK‚Äôs **NICE** uses a threshold of **¬£20,000‚Äì¬£30,000 per QALY**, indicating the maximum cost deemed acceptable for an additional QALY.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, WTP thresholds guide decisions on whether interventions like new drugs or screening programs are worth funding, ensuring alignment with national health priorities.

### üåç GDP-Based Thresholds

**WHO-CHOICE Recommendations**:  
- **<1√ó GDP per capita per DALY averted**: **Highly cost-effective**, indicating excellent value for money.  
- **1‚Äì3√ó GDP per capita per DALY averted**: **Cost-effective**, acceptable but less compelling.  
- **For Malaysia**:  
  - **1√ó GDP per capita ‚âà RM50,000**, leading to an **informal threshold** of **RM50,000‚Äì150,000 per QALY or DALY**.  
  - **Example**: An intervention with an ICER of RM40,000 per QALY is highly cost-effective, while one at RM80,000 is borderline.  
- **Caveat**: **GDP-based thresholds are criticized for being too simplistic and not context-sensitive**, as they may ignore **budget constraints** or **opportunity costs** specific to the health system.  

**Application**: In Malaysia, GDP-based thresholds provide a quick benchmark for evaluating interventions, but more nuanced approaches are often needed for precise decision-making.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Opportunity Cost-Based Thresholds

**Approach**: Estimates thresholds based on the **marginal productivity of health spending**, i.e., the health gained per RM spent in the current system.  

- **Purpose**: **Reflects what must be forgone when resources are diverted to a new intervention.** This approach considers the health benefits lost from other programs when funding a new one, providing a more context-specific threshold.  
- **Importance**: Opportunity cost-based thresholds are increasingly favored for their ability to account for **real-world budget constraints**, ensuring that new interventions do not displace more valuable existing services.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, this approach helps ensure that resources allocated to new interventions, such as cancer drugs, do not compromise other critical services like primary care or vaccinations.

### üìä Threshold Context in Malaysia

The table below summarizes **approximate threshold values** used in Malaysia for interpreting ICERs:

| **Threshold Type** | **Value (Approx.)** |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| **GDP per capita (1√ó)** | ~RM50,000 per QALY |
| **GDP per capita (3√ó)** | ~RM150,000 per QALY |
| **MoH/HTA Implied WTP (unofficial)** | RM90,000‚Äì120,000 per QALY |
| **Opportunity cost-based (estimated)** | ~RM30,000‚Äì50,000 per QALY |

- **Interpretation of RM80,000/QALY**:  
  - **Acceptable** for a **life-saving cancer drug with good QoL**, as it falls within or near the **MoH/HTA implied WTP** range (RM90,000‚Äì120,000), especially for high-priority conditions.  
  - **Less acceptable** for **low-impact interventions**, as it exceeds the **opportunity cost-based threshold** (RM30,000‚Äì50,000), indicating potential displacement of more valuable services.  
- **Application**: These thresholds guide decisions by Malaysia‚Äôs **Ministry of Health** or **MaHTAS**, ensuring that interventions align with budgetary and health priorities.

### ü©∫ Mini Case Example: Colorectal Cancer Drug

**Scenario**: Malaysia is considering a **new drug for colorectal cancer** compared to **standard care**. The table below presents the data:

| **Option** | **Cost (RM)** | **QALYs Gained** |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Standard Care** | 20,000 | 1.5 |
| **New Drug** | 60,000 | 2.0 |

**ICER Calculation**:

$$ \text{ICER} = \frac{60,000 - 20,000}{2.0 - 1.5} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = 80,000 \, \text{RM per QALY} $$

**Interpretation**:  
- **WTP-based threshold (e.g., RM100,000/QALY)**: The new drug is **cost-effective**, as its ICER is below the threshold, suggesting good value for money.  
- **GDP-based threshold (RM50,000)**: The ICER is **borderline or not cost-effective**, as it exceeds the 1√ó GDP per capita benchmark, indicating caution in adoption.  
- **Opportunity cost estimate (RM30,000‚Äì40,000)**: The new drug is **not cost-effective**, as it exceeds the threshold, suggesting that funding it may displace more valuable interventions.  

**Practical Importance**: This case demonstrates how ICERs guide decisions in Malaysia‚Äôs health system. The choice of threshold‚Äîwhether WTP, GDP-based, or opportunity cost-based‚Äîdepends on the **context**, **budget constraints**, and **disease severity**, ensuring that decisions balance **efficiency**, **equity**, and **impact**.

## üîç 8. Sensitivity Analysis

**Sensitivity analysis** is a critical component of economic evaluation, addressing the inherent uncertainties in data and assumptions. This section explores **why sensitivity analysis is needed**, the **types of sensitivity analysis**, their **application** in a breast cancer case, **visualization methods**, and the **purpose** of this technique. By testing how changes in parameters affect results, sensitivity analysis ensures that evaluations are **robust**, **transparent**, and **reliable**, supporting informed decision-making in resource-constrained health systems like Malaysia‚Äôs.

### ‚ùì Why Do We Need Sensitivity Analysis?

**Economic evaluations often rely on assumptions, estimates, and uncertain parameters** (e.g., cost data, utility values, treatment effects). **Real-world data are rarely perfect**, introducing uncertainty that can impact the reliability of conclusions. Sensitivity analysis addresses this by systematically testing how changes in these parameters affect the evaluation‚Äôs outcomes.

- **Purpose**: Answers **"How much would our conclusion change if the numbers change?"** This question ensures that decision-makers understand the robustness of results and the impact of uncertainty on policy recommendations.  
- **Importance**: Sensitivity analysis enhances the **credibility** of evaluations by identifying key drivers of cost-effectiveness and testing the stability of findings under varying conditions.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, sensitivity analysis is used by bodies like **MaHTAS** to ensure that Health Technology Assessments (HTAs) are reliable, especially when evaluating costly interventions like new cancer drugs.

### üìä Types of Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis encompasses various methods to test uncertainty, each suited to different evaluation needs. The table below summarizes the **types of sensitivity analysis** with examples from a breast cancer case:

| **Type** | **Description** | **Example (Breast Cancer)** |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| **One-way (Univariate)** | Vary one parameter at a time | Vary drug cost from RM60,000 to RM40,000 |
| **Multi-way** | Vary two or more parameters simultaneously | Vary drug cost and utility score |
| **Scenario Analysis** | Test different plausible real-world scenarios | Assume public vs. private provision costs |
| **Probabilistic (PSA)** | Assign distributions to parameters; use Monte Carlo simulation | 1,000 simulations of cost, utility values |
| **Threshold Analysis** | Determine at what value the result changes | At what drug price is Drug A no longer cost-effective? |

- **One-way (Univariate) Analysis**:  
  - **Description**: Varies **one parameter at a time** while keeping others constant to assess its impact on results.  
  - **Example**: Varying the cost of Drug A from **RM60,000 to RM40,000** to see how it affects the ICER.  
  - **Use**: Simple and focused, ideal for identifying the impact of individual parameters.  
- **Multi-way Analysis**:  
  - **Description**: Varies **two or more parameters simultaneously** to explore combined effects.  
  - **Example**: Varying **drug cost** and **utility score** together to assess their joint impact on cost-effectiveness.  
  - **Use**: Captures interactions between parameters, providing a more comprehensive view of uncertainty.  
- **Scenario Analysis**:  
  - **Description**: Tests **different plausible real-world scenarios** to reflect alternative conditions.  
  - **Example**: Assuming **public vs. private provision costs** for Drug A to compare cost-effectiveness in different healthcare settings.  
  - **Use**: Useful for policy-relevant scenarios, such as different funding models in Malaysia.  
- **Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA)**:  
  - **Description**: Assigns **distributions to parameters** and uses **Monte Carlo simulation** to run thousands of scenarios, capturing overall uncertainty.  
  - **Example**: Running **1,000 simulations** of cost and utility values to estimate the probability of Drug A being cost-effective.  
  - **Use**: Provides a robust assessment of uncertainty, widely used in HTAs.  
- **Threshold Analysis**:  
  - **Description**: Determines **at what value a result changes**, such as when an intervention is no longer cost-effective.  
  - **Example**: Identifying the **maximum acceptable price** for Drug A to stay below a RM100,000/QALY threshold.  
  - **Use**: Helps set boundaries for decision-making, such as acceptable drug prices.

**Practical Importance**: These methods allow evaluators to test a range of uncertainties, ensuring that results are **robust** and **applicable** to real-world contexts like Malaysia‚Äôs public health system.

### ü©∫ Example: Breast Cancer Drug A vs. B

This example applies sensitivity analysis to a breast cancer treatment evaluation, comparing **Drug A (targeted therapy)** versus **Drug B (standard chemotherapy)** with a **base ICER** of **RM80,000/QALY**:

- **One-way Analysis**:  
  - **If Drug A price drops to RM45,000 ‚Üí ICER = RM50,000/QALY ‚Üí Cost-effective.** A lower drug cost reduces the ICER, making Drug A more attractive compared to a threshold like RM100,000/QALY.  
  - **If utility value for Drug A is 0.7 instead of 0.8 ‚Üí ICER increases ‚Üí Less cost-effective.** A lower utility score reduces the health benefit, increasing the ICER and potentially making Drug A less viable.  
- **Threshold Analysis**:  
  - **What‚Äôs the maximum acceptable price for Drug A to stay below RM100,000/QALY?** This identifies the price point at which Drug A remains cost-effective, guiding pricing or reimbursement decisions.  

**Application**: This example shows how sensitivity analysis tests the **robustness** of the ICER, helping policymakers in Malaysia determine whether Drug A‚Äôs cost-effectiveness holds under varying conditions, such as price negotiations or changes in health outcomes.

### üìâ Visualizing Sensitivity Analysis

**Tornado Diagram**:  
- **Each horizontal bar represents how changing a specific input parameter affects the range of incremental costs.** For example, varying drug cost might produce a wide bar, indicating high impact.  
- **The wider the bar, the greater the influence of that parameter.** Parameters with larger impacts are prioritized in decision-making.  
- **Parameters are ordered from most to least influential.** This visual ranking helps identify **key drivers** of cost-effectiveness.  

**Importance**: Tornado diagrams provide a **clear visual representation** of uncertainty, making it easier for stakeholders like Malaysia‚Äôs **Ministry of Health** to understand which factors most affect an intervention‚Äôs value.

### üéØ Purpose of Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis serves several critical functions in economic evaluation:

- **Test robustness of results**: Ensures that conclusions hold under varying assumptions, increasing confidence in findings.  
- **Identify key drivers of cost-effectiveness**: Highlights parameters (e.g., drug cost, utility scores) that most influence results, guiding further research or policy focus.  
- **Inform confidence in policy recommendations**: Provides decision-makers with a clear understanding of the reliability of results, supporting evidence-based decisions.  
- **Support transparent decision-making**: By clearly showing how uncertainty affects outcomes, sensitivity analysis enhances the **transparency** and **credibility** of evaluations.  

**Practical Importance**: In Malaysia, sensitivity analysis is essential for **HTA** processes by **MaHTAS**, ensuring that evaluations of interventions like cancer therapies or vaccination programs are robust and reliable, even when data are uncertain.

## üßÆ 9. Economic Modeling

**Economic modeling** is a powerful tool in health economics, enabling evaluators to simulate complex clinical and economic processes when direct data are limited. This section explores **why economic models are used**, **when they are needed**, their **application** in a breast cancer case, the **types of models**, their **components**, **advantages**, and **limitations**. By understanding modeling, you will be equipped to assess **long-term outcomes** and **cost-effectiveness**, supporting **evidence-based** and **policy-relevant** decisions in contexts like Malaysia‚Äôs healthcare system.

### üõ†Ô∏è Why Use Economic Models?

**Economic models are simplified representations of real-world clinical and economic processes** used to address gaps in data and support decision-making. They provide a structured framework to simulate the impact of interventions over time and across scenarios.

- **Extrapolate outcomes beyond trial periods**: Models extend short-term trial data to predict long-term outcomes, such as survival or disease recurrence, which are critical for chronic conditions.  
- **Simulate long-term costs and effects**: They estimate costs and benefits over extended time horizons, capturing the full economic impact of interventions.  
- **Compare interventions where direct head-to-head studies are lacking**: Models allow comparisons when clinical trials do not directly compare alternatives, filling evidence gaps.  
- **Incorporate uncertainty in decision-making**: By testing various scenarios and assumptions, models account for data uncertainty, enhancing the robustness of evaluations.  
- **Importance**: Models are essential for **complex** or **long-term** health decisions, enabling policymakers in Malaysia to evaluate interventions like cancer treatments or vaccination programs when trial data are limited.  

### üìã When is Modeling Needed?

Economic modeling is particularly valuable in scenarios where direct data are insufficient or decisions require long-term projections. The table below outlines key scenarios where modeling is essential:

| **Scenario** | **Modeling Role** |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Short-term trial data, long-term outcomes** | Project outcomes over time (e.g., survival) |
| **Multiple care pathways or disease stages** | Capture complexity (e.g., recurrence, remission) |
| **Rare diseases or low-event outcomes** | Simulate events not captured in trials |
| **Budget impact or scenario forecasting** | Compare national-scale impact |

- **Short-term trial data, long-term outcomes**: Models project outcomes like survival beyond the duration of clinical trials, critical for chronic diseases.  
- **Multiple care pathways or disease stages**: Models capture complex disease progression, such as cancer stages (e.g., remission, recurrence), which trials may not fully cover.  
- **Rare diseases or low-event outcomes**: Models simulate rare events (e.g., complications) that occur infrequently in trials, ensuring comprehensive evaluation.  
- **Budget impact or scenario forecasting**: Models assess the national-scale impact of interventions, such as the cost of rolling out a new drug across Malaysia‚Äôs health system.  
- **Application**: In Malaysia, modeling is used by **MaHTAS** to evaluate interventions like cancer therapies, where long-term data or direct comparisons are often unavailable.

### ü©∫ Example: Breast Cancer Case

**Context**: A trial compares **Drug A** vs. **Drug B** for HER2+ breast cancer with only **2-year follow-up data**.  
**Challenges**:  
- **Disease may recur after 5 years.** Short-term data miss long-term recurrence risks.  
- **Survival may extend beyond the trial.** Benefits like extended life expectancy are not fully captured.  
- **Costs change post-treatment** (e.g., monitoring, recurrence management). Ongoing costs are not reflected in trial data.  
**Modeling Benefits**:  
- **Estimates lifetime QALYs**: Models project **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** over the patient‚Äôs lifespan, capturing long-term health benefits.  
- **Estimates long-term costs**: Models account for costs like monitoring or recurrence treatment, providing a comprehensive economic picture.  
- **Estimates cost-effectiveness**: Models calculate the **cost-effectiveness** of Drug A vs. Drug B over the patient‚Äôs lifespan, guiding decisions for Malaysia‚Äôs health system.  

**Application**: This example shows how modeling bridges data gaps, enabling **MaHTAS** or the **Ministry of Health** to assess the long-term value of cancer treatments, ensuring informed resource allocation.

### üß© Basic Types of Economic Models

Economic models vary in complexity and application, with two primary types used in health economics: **Decision Trees** and **Markov Models**.

1. **Decision Tree**  
   - **Use**: Suitable for **short-term, one-time decisions**.  
   - **Structure**: **Branches represent choices and possible outcomes**, creating a tree-like diagram of decision points and consequences.  
   - **Characteristics**: **Simple and intuitive**, making it easy to visualize and understand.  
   - **Example**: Choosing between **Drug A and Drug B** for a **6-month adjuvant treatment course** in breast cancer, where outcomes like treatment success or failure are modeled.  
   - **Application**: Ideal for acute conditions or short-term interventions in Malaysia, such as evaluating surgical options.

2. **Markov Model**  
   - **Use**: Suitable for **chronic conditions or recurrent events**.  
   - **Structure**: **Patients transition between health states** (e.g., well, recurrence, dead), reflecting disease progression.  
   - **Time**: Divided into **cycles** (e.g., yearly), allowing for repeated transitions over time.  
   - **Example**: Modeling transitions in breast cancer: **Well ‚Üí Local recurrence ‚Üí Metastasis ‚Üí Death**, capturing the dynamic nature of the disease.  
   - **Application**: Widely used in Malaysia for chronic diseases like cancer or diabetes, where long-term outcomes are critical.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Components of a Markov Model

Markov models are particularly suited for chronic conditions, with the following key components:

- **States**: **Mutually exclusive** health states (e.g., stable, recurrence, death), representing distinct stages of a patient‚Äôs condition.  
- **Cycles**: **Time steps** (e.g., yearly), during which patients may transition between states.  
- **Transition Probabilities**: **Likelihood of moving between states**, based on clinical data or estimates (e.g., probability of cancer recurrence).  
- **Utilities and Costs**: **Assigned to each state per cycle**, capturing health benefits (e.g., QALYs) and costs (e.g., treatment costs) associated with each state.  

**Importance**: These components allow Markov models to simulate complex disease progression, making them essential for evaluating long-term interventions in Malaysia‚Äôs health system.

### üåü Advantages of Modeling

Economic models offer several benefits that enhance the quality of evaluations:

- **Captures long-term outcomes**: Models project outcomes like survival or quality of life beyond trial periods, critical for chronic diseases.  
- **Incorporates patient-level variability**: Models account for differences in patient outcomes, improving accuracy.  
- **Useful for scenario analysis and policy planning**: Models test various scenarios (e.g., different treatment uptake rates), supporting strategic decisions in Malaysia‚Äôs health policy.  

**Application**: Models enable **MaHTAS** to evaluate the long-term impact of interventions, ensuring that resources are allocated to high-value programs.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

Despite their benefits, economic models have notable limitations:

- **Depends heavily on assumptions**: Models rely on estimated parameters (e.g., transition probabilities), which may introduce uncertainty.  
- **Quality of model = quality of inputs**: Inaccurate or incomplete data can compromise model reliability.  
- **Complex models can become opaque if not transparent**: Without clear documentation, complex models may be difficult to interpret, reducing trust in results.  

**Practical Importance**: In Malaysia, ensuring **transparent** and **high-quality inputs** is critical for models used in **HTA** processes, maintaining credibility and supporting evidence-based decisions.

## ü©∫ 10. Case Study: Comparing Drug A vs. Drug B for HER2+ Breast Cancer

This section presents a **case study** applying the principles of economic evaluation to compare **Drug A (new targeted therapy)** versus **Drug B (standard chemotherapy)** for women with early-stage **HER2+ breast cancer**. It covers the **scenario overview**, **input data and calculations**, and **interpretation of results**, illustrating how economic evaluation informs real-world health policy decisions. By integrating key concepts like perspective, time horizon, and the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), this case study demonstrates how to assess **cost-effectiveness** in Malaysia‚Äôs healthcare system, ensuring **evidence-based** and **policy-relevant** outcomes.

### üìã Scenario Overview

The case study focuses on a practical health policy question relevant to Malaysia‚Äôs public health system, evaluating whether a new targeted therapy (Drug A) should be adopted over standard chemotherapy (Drug B) for HER2+ breast cancer.

- **Target Population**: **Women with early-stage HER2+ breast cancer**, a group requiring effective treatment to improve survival and quality of life.  
- **Perspective**: **Health system**, focusing on costs borne by healthcare providers, such as hospitals or the Ministry of Health, aligning with budget planning priorities.  
- **Time Horizon**: **5 years**, chosen to capture both short-term treatment costs and medium-term health outcomes, such as survival and recurrence prevention.  
- **Discount Rate**: **$3\%$ (applied but simplified for illustration)**, reflecting Malaysia‚Äôs standard rate for Health Technology Assessments (HTA) to adjust future costs and benefits to their present value.  

**Importance**: This scenario outlines the key parameters of the evaluation, ensuring that the analysis is **context-specific** and aligned with the needs of Malaysia‚Äôs health system, such as those addressed by **MaHTAS**.

### üìä Input Data and Calculations

The evaluation compares **Drug A** and **Drug B** based on their costs and health outcomes, measured in **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**. The table below presents the input data:

| **Intervention** | **Cost (RM)** | **QALYs Gained** |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Drug B (Standard)** | 20,000 | 1.5 |
| **Drug A (New)** | 60,000 | 2.0 |

**Calculations**:  
- **Incremental Cost**: $\text{Cost}_A - \text{Cost}_B = 60,000 - 20,000 = 40,000 \, \text{RM}$  
  This represents the additional cost of adopting Drug A over Drug B.  
- **Incremental QALYs**: $2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5 \, \text{QALY}$  
  This indicates that Drug A provides an additional 0.5 QALYs compared to Drug B.  
- **ICER**:  
  $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = 80,000 \, \text{RM per QALY} $$  
  The ICER shows that adopting Drug A costs an additional **RM80,000 per QALY gained** compared to Drug B.  

**Practical Importance**: These calculations provide a **quantitative basis** for comparing Drug A and Drug B, enabling policymakers to assess whether the additional health benefits of Drug A justify its higher cost. In Malaysia, such calculations are critical for decisions about including new drugs in the **MyHEALTH formulary**.

### ü§î Interpreting the Result

The **ICER** of **RM80,000 per QALY** must be compared to relevant thresholds to determine whether Drug A is cost-effective. The interpretation depends on the **threshold** used and the **context** of the decision:

- **If ICER threshold is RM100,000/QALY**: **Drug A is cost-effective.** The ICER of RM80,000 per QALY is below this threshold, suggesting that the additional cost is justified by the health benefits, making Drug A a viable option for adoption.  
- **If using 1√ó GDP threshold (~RM50,000/QALY)**: **Drug A is not cost-effective.** The ICER exceeds Malaysia‚Äôs informal GDP-based threshold, indicating that the additional cost may not be justified compared to other interventions.  
- **Final Decision Depends On**:  
  - **Budget constraints**: Limited health system budgets, as in Malaysia, may prioritize interventions with lower ICERs to maximize resource efficiency.  
  - **Severity of disease**: The life-threatening nature of HER2+ breast cancer may justify a higher ICER, especially if Drug A significantly improves survival or quality of life.  
  - **Equity considerations**: Ensuring access to effective treatments for underserved populations, such as through programs like **Peka B40**, may influence the decision to adopt Drug A despite its cost.  

**Application**: This interpretation guides Malaysia‚Äôs **Ministry of Health** or **MaHTAS** in deciding whether to fund Drug A, balancing **cost-effectiveness**, **clinical impact**, and **equity**. For example, a higher ICER might be acceptable for a life-saving cancer drug with significant quality-of-life benefits.

**Practical Importance**: The case study illustrates how **incremental analysis** and **ICER** provide a structured approach to evaluate health interventions. By comparing the ICER to context-specific thresholds, policymakers can make **evidence-based decisions** that align with Malaysia‚Äôs health priorities, ensuring **efficient** and **equitable** resource allocation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 11. Common Mistakes in Economic Evaluation

Conducting a robust economic evaluation is a complex process that demands **precision**, **transparency**, and **contextual relevance**. This section outlines **seven common mistakes** to avoid, providing insights into their **importance**, **potential pitfalls**, and **illustrative examples**. By understanding these errors, you will be better equipped to design and interpret evaluations that are **credible**, **reproducible**, and **policy-relevant**, ensuring effective decision-making in Malaysia‚Äôs healthcare system and beyond.

### üö® Overview

**Conducting a robust economic evaluation requires methodological clarity, transparent assumptions, and contextual relevance.** Errors in methodology or execution can undermine the validity of results, leading to misguided policy decisions. Below are **seven common mistakes** to avoid, each with significant implications for the quality and utility of economic evaluations:

### Mistake 1: Inappropriate or Unstated Perspective

- **Why It Matters**: **Perspective determines what costs and outcomes are included.** The choice of perspective (e.g., societal, health system, patient) shapes the scope of the analysis and ensures alignment with the decision-making context.  
- **Pitfall**: **Choosing a narrow perspective (e.g., provider only) when broader societal impact is relevant.** An inappropriate perspective can exclude critical costs or outcomes, leading to misleading conclusions. Similarly, failing to state the perspective reduces transparency and reproducibility.  
- **Example**: **Ignoring out-of-pocket costs in a study on cancer care for low-income populations.** A health system perspective might focus only on hospital costs, missing patient financial burdens, which are critical for equity-focused policies like Malaysia‚Äôs **Peka B40** program.  
- **Implication**: An inappropriate or unstated perspective can misalign the evaluation with stakeholder needs, such as those of **MaHTAS**, leading to decisions that overlook key impacts like patient affordability.

### Mistake 2: Incorrect or Inconsistent Costing

- **Why It Matters**: **Accurate costing is the foundation of economic evaluation.** Costs must reflect the true resource use to ensure credible comparisons between interventions.  
- **Pitfall**: **Using outdated prices, not adjusting for inflation, or mixing price sources.** Inconsistent costing methods (e.g., using private hospital rates for a public sector evaluation) can distort results, undermining the evaluation‚Äôs validity.  
- **Example**: **Drug costs based on private hospital rates in a public sector evaluation.** Using private sector prices (e.g., RM5,000 per drug cycle) instead of public sector tariffs (e.g., RM1,200) can inflate costs, leading to incorrect conclusions about cost-effectiveness.  
- **Implication**: In Malaysia, accurate costing is critical for **Ministry of Health** budget planning, and errors can lead to inefficient resource allocation or rejection of valuable interventions.

### Mistake 3: Inadequate Time Horizon

- **Why It Matters**: **Short horizons can miss long-term benefits or harms.** The time horizon must be long enough to capture all relevant costs and outcomes, especially for chronic or progressive conditions.  
- **Pitfall**: **Limiting analysis to trial duration for chronic or progressive conditions.** A short horizon may exclude significant long-term effects, biasing results against interventions with delayed benefits.  
- **Example**: **1-year horizon in breast cancer where recurrence risk continues for 10+ years.** A 1-year horizon captures only immediate drug costs, missing long-term benefits like reduced recurrence or extended survival, potentially deeming a valuable treatment not cost-effective.  
- **Implication**: In Malaysia, where chronic diseases like cancer are a priority, an inadequate time horizon can lead to underestimating the value of interventions, affecting **MaHTAS** evaluations.

### Mistake 4: No Discounting of Future Costs/Benefits

- **Why It Matters**: **Time preference must be accounted for in longer-term evaluations.** Future costs and benefits are worth less than immediate ones, requiring discounting to ensure fair comparisons.  
- **Pitfall**: **Ignoring discounting when the time horizon exceeds 1 year.** Failing to apply a discount rate overvalues future outcomes, distorting cost-effectiveness results.  
- **Example**: **Reporting lifelong QALYs without applying a discount rate.** Without discounting, a treatment yielding 0.8 QALYs over 5 years is overvalued compared to a discounted value (e.g., $\approx 0.76$ QALYs at $3\%$), leading to inaccurate conclusions.  
- **Implication**: In Malaysia, where **MaHTAS** uses a $3\%$ discount rate, omitting discounting can misguide decisions on long-term interventions like cancer therapies or vaccinations.

### Mistake 5: Missing or Weak Sensitivity Analysis

- **Why It Matters**: **Real-world data is uncertain, and robust decisions require uncertainty testing.** Sensitivity analysis ensures that results are reliable under varying assumptions.  
- **Pitfall**: **No sensitivity analysis or only testing trivial variables.** Failing to test key parameters or conducting superficial analyses reduces confidence in results.  
- **Example**: **Not testing variations in utility scores for high-impact side effects.** Ignoring how changes in quality-of-life scores (e.g., from 0.8 to 0.7) affect the ICER can overlook critical uncertainties in cancer treatment evaluations.  
- **Implication**: In Malaysia, robust sensitivity analysis is essential for **HTA** processes, ensuring that evaluations remain credible despite data uncertainties.

### Mistake 6: No Incremental Comparison or ICER Misuse

- **Why It Matters**: **ICER is core to decision-making.** The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) quantifies the additional cost per unit of health benefit, enabling fair comparisons.  
- **Pitfall**: **Reporting total cost and QALY without comparing alternatives.** Presenting only total values without an incremental analysis fails to show relative value.  
- **Example**: **"Drug A yields 2 QALYs at RM70,000" without comparing Drug B, making it unclear if it‚Äôs better.** Without an ICER, decision-makers cannot assess whether Drug A‚Äôs benefits justify its cost compared to Drug B.  
- **Implication**: In Malaysia, proper ICER use is critical for **MaHTAS** to compare interventions like new drugs, ensuring decisions are evidence-based.

### Mistake 7: Lack of Transparency or Reproducibility

- **Why It Matters**: **Policymakers and HTA agencies must understand assumptions.** Transparent reporting ensures that evaluations are credible and reproducible.  
- **Pitfall**: **No clear reporting of data sources, model assumptions, or analytic methods.** Opaque evaluations reduce trust and usability.  
- **Example**: **Using a Markov model without showing transition probabilities or utility weights.** Without documenting these inputs, stakeholders cannot verify the model‚Äôs validity, undermining its use in policy decisions.  
- **Implication**: In Malaysia, transparency is vital for **Ministry of Health** and **MaHTAS** evaluations, ensuring that results are trusted and actionable.

**Practical Importance**: Avoiding these mistakes ensures that economic evaluations are **robust**, **transparent**, and **aligned** with Malaysia‚Äôs health policy needs, such as those for **Universal Health Coverage** or **Peka B40**. By addressing these pitfalls, evaluators can produce **credible** results that support **efficient** and **equitable** resource allocation.

The foundation of every good economic evaluation lies in:

- **Clear definition of the problem and perspective**:  
  - **Problem Definition**: Clearly stating the health issue or policy question (e.g., whether to adopt a new cancer drug) ensures the evaluation is focused and relevant.  
  - **Perspective**: Choosing the appropriate perspective (e.g., societal, health system, patient) determines which costs and outcomes are included, aligning the analysis with stakeholder needs, such as those of Malaysia‚Äôs **MaHTAS** or **Ministry of Health**.  
  - **Importance**: A well-defined problem and perspective ensure that the evaluation addresses the right question and captures the relevant impacts, avoiding misaligned or misleading conclusions.

- **Accurate costing and meaningful outcome measurement**:  
  - **Accurate Costing**: Systematically identifying, measuring, and valuing costs (e.g., direct medical, indirect, intangible) ensures that the financial burden of interventions is fully captured. For example, costing a new drug includes drug acquisition, monitoring, and side-effect management costs.  
  - **Meaningful Outcome Measurement**: Using appropriate outcomes (e.g., QALYs, life-years gained) ensures that the health benefits are relevant and measurable. In Malaysia, **QALYs** are often used in **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)** to assess quality of life impacts.  
  - **Importance**: Accurate and meaningful data provide a solid foundation for comparing interventions, ensuring **credibility** in evaluations.

- **Use of ICER and modeling to inform long-term decisions**:  
  - **ICER**: The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, calculated as  
    $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{New}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{Comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{New}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{Comparator}}} $$  
    quantifies the additional cost per unit of health benefit, guiding decisions on whether an intervention‚Äôs benefits justify its costs.  
  - **Modeling**: Tools like **decision trees** and **Markov models** simulate long-term costs and outcomes, bridging data gaps for chronic or complex conditions like cancer.  
  - **Importance**: These tools enable evaluations to capture **long-term impacts**, critical for Malaysia‚Äôs health system when assessing interventions like **vaccination programs** or **chronic disease treatments**.

- **Testing uncertainty through sensitivity analysis**:  
  - **Sensitivity Analysis**: Tests how changes in parameters (e.g., costs, utilities) affect results, using methods like **one-way**, **multi-way**, or **probabilistic analysis**. This ensures **robustness** and identifies key drivers of cost-effectiveness.  
  - **Importance**: By addressing uncertainty, sensitivity analysis enhances **confidence** in results, making evaluations reliable for policy decisions in Malaysia‚Äôs **HTA** processes.

**Practical Importance**: By adhering to these principles, economic evaluations can **support wise decisions** that maximize health outcomes within resource constraints. In Malaysia, this approach ensures that resources are allocated **efficiently** and **equitably**, supporting initiatives like **Universal Health Coverage** and **Peka B40** by prioritizing high-value interventions.

**Application**: These principles are critical for Malaysia‚Äôs **Ministry of Health** and **MaHTAS**, where evaluations guide decisions on adopting new drugs, scaling up programs, or allocating budgets. For example, evaluating a new cancer therapy requires a clear problem definition (e.g., improving survival), a health system perspective, accurate costing (e.g., drug and monitoring costs), meaningful outcomes (e.g., QALYs), ICER calculations, modeling for long-term effects, and sensitivity analysis to test uncertainties, ensuring a **robust** and **transparent** decision-making process.
