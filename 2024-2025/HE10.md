## 🩺 2. Recap of Economic Evaluation Basics

This section revisits the **foundational concepts** of economic evaluation, setting the stage for the practical methodologies covered in **Economic Evaluation II** to ensure students grasp the **core principles**, **types**, and **perspectives** of economic evaluation, which are critical for making informed decisions in Malaysia’s resource-scarce healthcare system 🌍. By understanding **what economic evaluation is**, **how it varies**, and **why perspective matters**, students can better appreciate the tools and steps needed to conduct robust evaluations that maximize health outcomes efficiently 🩺.

### 📖 What is Economic Evaluation?

- **Definition**: _“A comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences.”_
    - **Source**: Drummond et al. (2005).
- **Core Idea**: Economic evaluation helps decision-makers allocate **limited resources** efficiently by evaluating both **costs** and **outcomes** 💰.

**Explanation**: Economic evaluation is a structured approach to compare healthcare interventions, such as a new drug versus standard treatment, by weighing their **financial costs** against their **health benefits**. In Malaysia, where healthcare budgets are constrained, this process is vital for ensuring that every ringgit spent delivers the **maximum health impact**. For example, deciding whether to fund a new cancer therapy requires analyzing not just the price of the drug but also the additional years of life or quality of life it provides. This **dual focus** on costs and outcomes makes economic evaluation a cornerstone of **evidence-based decision-making** in public health 🌟.

### 📊 Types of Economic Evaluation

Economic evaluations come in different forms, each suited to specific decision-making contexts. The table below summarizes the **four main types**, their **outcome measures**, and the **questions they answer**:

|**Type**|**Outcome Measure**|**Decision Focus**|
|---|---|---|
|**CMA**|Same outcomes|Which is cheaper?|
|**CEA**|Natural units (e.g., life-years gained)|Which gives more health for the cost?|
|**CUA**|Utility-based (e.g., QALYs, DALYs)|Which gives more value considering quality of life?|
|**CBA**|Money (e.g., RM)|Do monetary benefits exceed costs?|

- **Note**: **Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)** is rarely used unless **equivalency of outcomes** is proven.

**Elaboration**:

- **CMA (Cost-Minimization Analysis)**: Used when two interventions produce **identical outcomes**, focusing solely on which option is **less expensive**. For instance, if two drugs treat a condition equally well, CMA identifies the cheaper one. Its limited use stems from the difficulty of proving outcome equivalence 📉.
- **CEA (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis)**: Measures outcomes in **natural units**, like life-years gained or cases prevented, making it ideal for comparing interventions with similar health goals. For example, CEA could compare two vaccines based on how many infections they prevent per ringgit spent 🩺.
- **CUA (Cost-Utility Analysis)**: Incorporates **quality of life** using measures like **QALYs** (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) or **DALYs** (Disability-Adjusted Life Years). This is useful when interventions affect both **length** and **quality** of life, such as comparing cancer treatments with different side effects 🌟.
- **CBA (Cost-Benefit Analysis)**: Converts all outcomes into **monetary terms**, allowing comparison across diverse interventions. For example, CBA might assess whether the economic benefits of a public health campaign (e.g., reduced sick days) outweigh its costs 💸.
- **Key Insight**: The choice of evaluation type depends on the **decision context** and the **type of outcome** most relevant to stakeholders. In Malaysia, **CUA** is often used in health technology assessments (HTA) to balance quality of life with cost considerations.

### 🧠 Key Economic Principles

Economic evaluations are grounded in **fundamental economic principles** that guide resource allocation decisions in healthcare. These principles are essential for understanding **why** and **how** evaluations are conducted:

- **Scarcity**: Resources are **limited**, necessitating **choices** 📉.
- **Opportunity Cost**: The **value** of the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made 💸.
- **Efficiency**: Maximizing **health outcomes** per unit of resource 🌟.
- **Marginal Analysis**: Evaluating the **incremental cost** and **effect** of a change in resource use 📈.

**Elaboration**:

- **Scarcity**: In Malaysia’s health system, budgets for hospitals, drugs, and preventive programs are finite. This forces decision-makers to prioritize interventions, such as choosing between expanding dialysis services or funding a vaccination program. **Scarcity** drives the need for economic evaluation to identify the **best use** of limited resources.
- **Opportunity Cost**: Every decision has a trade-off. For example, spending on a new cancer drug means forgoing funds for maternal health programs. The **opportunity cost** is the health benefits lost from the unchosen option, making it critical to evaluate whether the chosen intervention delivers greater value 💡.
- **Efficiency**: The goal is to achieve the **maximum health benefit** for every ringgit spent. Economic evaluation helps identify interventions that offer the **best health outcomes** relative to their costs, such as a cost-effective screening program that detects diseases early 🩺.
- **Marginal Analysis**: Focuses on the **additional costs** and **benefits** of scaling up an intervention. For instance, adding more hospital beds may improve care, but marginal analysis assesses whether the extra cost is justified by the additional health gains 📊.

**Practical Application**: These principles underpin every economic evaluation, ensuring that decisions are **rational**, **transparent**, and aligned with the goal of **maximizing health** within budget constraints. In Malaysia, applying these principles helps policymakers navigate tough choices, such as prioritizing rural healthcare access over urban hospital upgrades.

### 👁️ Importance of Perspective

- **Definition**: _Perspective defines whose costs and benefits are counted in an evaluation._
- **Impact**: Different perspectives yield **different conclusions** for the same intervention.
- **Common Perspectives**:

|**Perspective**|**Costs Included**|**Common Use**|
|---|---|---|
|**Societal**|All costs (direct, indirect, intangible)|Academics, global health agencies|
|**Health System/Provider**|Direct medical costs only|Ministries of Health, HTA bodies|
|**Payer**|Reimbursed/claimable medical expenses|Insurance schemes, MySalam, employers|
|**Patient**|Out-of-pocket costs, lost income|Advocacy groups, equity researchers|

**Elaboration**:

- **Perspective Defined**: The **perspective** determines the **scope** of an economic evaluation by specifying which **costs** (e.g., drug prices, travel expenses) and **benefits** (e.g., health gains, productivity) are included. Choosing the right perspective ensures the evaluation aligns with the **stakeholder’s priorities**.
- **Societal Perspective**: Captures **all costs and benefits**, including medical costs, patient travel, lost wages, and even intangible costs like pain. This broad view is favored by academics and global health agencies for its **comprehensive** approach, but it’s complex to implement due to data demands 🌍.
- **Health System/Provider Perspective**: Focuses on **direct medical costs** (e.g., hospital stays, medications) borne by healthcare providers or the Ministry of Health. This is common in Malaysia’s HTA processes, as it reflects **budgetary constraints** of public healthcare systems 🩺.
- **Payer Perspective**: Includes only **reimbursed costs**, such as those covered by insurance or schemes like MySalam. This perspective is relevant for insurers or employers managing healthcare claims 💸.
- **Patient Perspective**: Centers on **out-of-pocket costs** (e.g., co-pays, transport) and **lost income** due to illness or treatment. This is critical for **equity studies**, highlighting the financial burden on patients, especially in low-income communities ⚖️.
- **Impact of Perspective**: The same intervention, like a new cancer drug, may appear **cost-effective** from a **societal perspective** (due to productivity gains) but **not cost-effective** from a **health system perspective** (due to high drug costs). In Malaysia, choosing the appropriate perspective is crucial for aligning evaluations with **policy goals**, such as improving access or controlling budgets.

**Example in Context**: Consider a mobile dental clinic for rural Malaysia. A **societal perspective** might justify its cost by including reduced travel expenses and improved productivity for patients. However, a **health system perspective** might focus only on the clinic’s operational costs, potentially deeming it too expensive. Understanding these differences helps policymakers interpret evaluation results accurately 📊.

### 📋 Summary Table: Key Concepts in Economic Evaluation

|**Concept**|**Description**|**Relevance to Malaysia**|
|---|---|---|
|**Economic Evaluation**|Compares costs and consequences of interventions|Guides efficient resource allocation in a scarce healthcare system 💰|
|**Types (CMA, CEA, CUA, CBA)**|Vary by outcome measure and decision focus|Enables tailored evaluations, e.g., CUA for quality-of-life-focused interventions 🩺|
|**Principles**|Scarcity, opportunity cost, efficiency, marginal analysis|Ensures rational, evidence-based decisions under budget constraints 🌟|
|**Perspective**|Defines whose costs/benefits are counted|Aligns evaluations with stakeholder needs, e.g., MOH or patients ⚖️|

A well-defined problem ensures the evaluation addresses a **specific, actionable question**. For instance, the HPV vaccine example focuses on expanding vaccination to boys, comparing it to the existing girls-only program or no vaccination. **Clinical relevance** ensures the interventions are practical in Malaysia’s healthcare context, while **feasibility** considers factors like cost, infrastructure, and acceptability. This step is crucial for aligning the evaluation with **policy priorities**, such as reducing cervical cancer rates, and sets the scope for subsequent steps 📋.

### 👁️ Step 2: Choose the Perspective

- **Purpose**: Determines which **costs** and **benefits** are included in the analysis.
- **Common Perspectives**:
    - **Societal**: All costs and outcomes (direct, indirect, intangible).
    - **Health System**: Direct medical costs (e.g., drugs, hospital stays).
    - **Payer**: Reimbursed costs (e.g., insurance claims).
    - **Patient**: Out-of-pocket costs and productivity losses.
- **Impact**: Perspective affects the **interpretation of value** (e.g., societal may favor interventions with productivity gains, while health system may prioritize budget impact).

**Elaboration**: Selecting a **perspective** defines the **lens** through which the evaluation views costs and benefits, directly influencing the results. For example, a **societal perspective** in the HPV vaccine case would include costs like lost productivity from cervical cancer and benefits like reduced healthcare costs across generations, making the vaccine appear more cost-effective. In contrast, a **health system perspective** might focus solely on vaccine procurement and delivery costs, potentially deeming it less affordable. In Malaysia, the **health system perspective** is often used by the Ministry of Health for budget-focused decisions, while the **patient perspective** highlights **equity** concerns, such as out-of-pocket expenses for rural communities. Choosing the right perspective ensures the evaluation aligns with the **stakeholder’s priorities**, enhancing its **policy relevance** 👀.

### ⏰ Step 3: Set the Time Horizon

- **Definition**: The **duration** over which **costs** and **outcomes** are measured.
- **Considerations**:
    - Must be **long enough** to capture **meaningful effects**.
    - **Short-term** (e.g., 1 year) for acute conditions.
    - **Long-term** (e.g., lifetime) for chronic diseases.
- **Risk**: A **short horizon** may miss **delayed benefits** or **costs**.
- **Example**: A **5-year horizon** for a mobile dental clinic may capture initial costs but miss long-term oral health gains.

**Elaboration**: The **time horizon** determines how far into the future the evaluation looks, impacting the **completeness** of the analysis. For acute conditions like influenza, a **1-year horizon** may suffice, but chronic diseases like diabetes or interventions like dental clinics require **long-term horizons** to capture outcomes such as reduced complications or improved quality of life. In the mobile dental clinic example, a **5-year horizon** might cover setup costs but fail to account for **long-term benefits** like fewer extractions or better oral health in rural areas. Choosing an **appropriate horizon** is critical in Malaysia, where **preventive interventions** often have delayed benefits that justify initial investments, ensuring evaluations don’t undervalue high-impact programs ⏳.

### 💰 Step 4: Identify, Measure, and Value Costs

- **Types of Costs**:
    - **Direct Medical**: Hospital stays, drugs, staff time 🩺.
    - **Direct Non-Medical**: Transport, caregiving 🚗.
    - **Indirect**: Lost productivity due to illness or treatment 💼.
    - **Intangible**: Pain, anxiety (rarely quantified) 😟.
- **Process**:
    - Use **real-world data**, **costing studies**, or **tariffs** to ensure accuracy.
    - Align costs with the chosen **perspective**.
- **Importance**: Accurate cost data is **essential** for credible evaluations.

**Elaboration**: This step involves a **three-part process**: identifying **what** resources are used, **measuring** how much is used, and **valuing** those resources in monetary terms. For example, evaluating the HPV vaccine requires listing **direct medical costs** (vaccine doses, nurse time), **direct non-medical costs** (travel to clinics), **indirect costs** (parental time off work), and, if societal, **intangible costs** like anxiety about side effects. **Real-world data** from Malaysia’s healthcare system, such as hospital tariffs or costing studies, ensures accuracy, while aligning costs with the **perspective** (e.g., excluding patient travel in a health system perspective) maintains relevance. **Accurate costing** builds trust in the evaluation, especially for policymakers deciding whether to fund costly interventions 💸.

### 📈 Step 5: Identify and Measure Outcomes

- **Types**:
    - **Natural Units**: Cases detected, life-years gained (for CEA).
    - **Utility-Based**: QALYs, DALYs (for CUA).
    - **Monetary**: RM value (for CBA).
- **Requirements**:
    - Outcomes must be **meaningful**, **measurable**, and **valid**.
    - Choice of outcome determines the **evaluation type** (CEA, CUA, CBA).

**Elaboration**: Outcomes reflect the **health benefits** of an intervention, and selecting the right type is crucial for a **meaningful evaluation**. **Natural units** like life-years gained are used in **CEA** for straightforward comparisons, such as how many years the HPV vaccine extends life by preventing cancer. **Utility-based outcomes** like **QALYs** (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) or **DALYs** (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) are used in **CUA** to capture both **quantity** and **quality** of life, vital for interventions with side effects. **Monetary outcomes** in **CBA** convert benefits to ringgit, useful for cross-sector comparisons. In Malaysia, **QALYs** are common in health technology assessments, ensuring outcomes are **measurable** (via tools like EQ-5D) and **valid** (reflecting patient experiences). The outcome choice shapes the evaluation’s **focus** and **policy impact** 📊.

### ⏳ Step 6: Apply Discounting (If Needed)

- **Definition**: _Adjusting future costs and outcomes to their present value to reflect time preference (value now > value later)._
- **When Applied**: For **time horizons** exceeding **1 year**.
- **Common Discount Rates**: **3–5%** annually.
- **Purpose**: Ensures **fair comparison** between interventions with different timing of costs and benefits.
- **Example**: A **3% discount rate** reduces future QALYs and costs in long-term interventions like cancer treatment.

**Elaboration**: **Discounting** accounts for the **time value** of money and health benefits, recognizing that people prefer benefits now over later. For time horizons beyond **1 year**, a **3–5% annual discount rate** is applied, with Malaysia’s HTA often using **3%**. For instance, in a cancer treatment evaluation, future costs (e.g., follow-up care in year 5) and outcomes (e.g., QALYs gained) are discounted to their **present value**, ensuring a **fair comparison** with interventions yielding immediate benefits. In the HPV vaccine case, discounting reduces the value of future cancer prevention benefits, affecting cost-effectiveness. This step is critical for **long-term interventions** in Malaysia, where preventive programs like vaccinations require careful consideration of future impacts 🕰️.

### 📊 Step 7: Conduct Incremental Analysis

- **Definition**: _Compares the additional cost and benefit of one intervention versus another._
- **Tool**: **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**:  
    $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_A - \text{Cost}_B}{\text{Effect}_A - \text{Effect}_B} $$
    - **Numerator**: Incremental cost (RM).
    - **Denominator**: Incremental effectiveness (e.g., QALYs, life-years).
- **Interpretation**: Compare ICER against **thresholds** (e.g., willingness-to-pay, GDP-based, or opportunity cost-based).
- **Purpose**: Determines if the **extra cost** is worth the **extra benefit**.

**Elaboration**: **Incremental analysis** focuses on the **additional** costs and benefits of one intervention over another, using the **ICER** to quantify value. The formula, $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_A - \text{Cost}_B}{\text{Effect}_A - \text{Effect}_B} $$, calculates the cost per additional unit of effectiveness (e.g., RM per QALY). For the HPV vaccine, if vaccinating boys costs RM 10 million more but yields 1,000 additional QALYs, the ICER is RM 10,000/QALY. This is compared to **thresholds** like Malaysia’s GDP-based threshold (RM 50,000–150,000/QALY) to assess cost-effectiveness. In Malaysia, ICERs guide **resource allocation**, helping policymakers decide whether the **extra cost** justifies the **health gains**, especially for high-cost interventions like new drugs 📈.

### 🔬 Step 8: Perform Sensitivity Analysis

- **Purpose**: Tests how **results change** under **uncertainty** in parameters (e.g., costs, outcomes).
- **Types**:
    - **One-Way**: Vary one parameter at a time.
    - **Multi-Way**: Vary multiple parameters simultaneously.
    - **Probabilistic**: Use Monte Carlo simulations with parameter distributions.
- **Benefits**:
    - Identifies **key drivers** of cost-effectiveness.
    - Enhances **confidence** in conclusions by assessing robustness.

**Elaboration**: **Sensitivity analysis** addresses **uncertainty** in data, such as fluctuating drug prices or variable health outcomes, ensuring evaluations are **robust**. **One-way analysis** tests a single parameter, like vaccine cost, to see its impact on the ICER. **Multi-way analysis** combines multiple changes, such as cost and efficacy. **Probabilistic analysis** uses simulations to model real-world variability, providing a range of possible ICERs. In the HPV vaccine case, sensitivity analysis might reveal that cost-effectiveness hinges on vaccine price, guiding negotiations with suppliers. In Malaysia, this step builds **confidence** in policy recommendations, ensuring decisions hold up under varying conditions 🔍.

### 🧮 Step 9: Use Modeling (If Applicable)

- **Purpose**: Simulates **complex** or **long-term** scenarios where direct data are limited.
- **Tools**:
    - **Decision Trees**: For short-term, one-time decisions.
    - **Markov Models**: For chronic or recurring conditions.
- **Role**: Bridges **data gaps**, supports **extrapolation**, and incorporates **uncertainty**.

**Elaboration**: **Modeling** creates **simplified representations** of complex healthcare scenarios, especially when trial data is limited. **Decision trees** are ideal for short-term decisions, like choosing between two surgical procedures, mapping out possible outcomes. **Markov models** suit chronic conditions, like cancer, by tracking patients through health states (e.g., healthy, diseased, dead) over time. For the HPV vaccine, a Markov model might simulate long-term cancer prevention, filling **data gaps** from short-term trials. In Malaysia, modeling is crucial for **preventive interventions**, allowing policymakers to project long-term benefits and costs, enhancing **decision-making** 📊.

### 📜 Step 10: Interpret and Present Results

- **Methods**:
    - Use **cost-effectiveness planes**, **league tables**, or **net benefit** analyses.
    - Report **clearly**, **transparently**, and with **context**.
- **Alignment**: Results must align with **policy priorities** and **resource constraints**.
- **Goal**: Inform **action**, not just analysis.

**Elaboration**: The final step translates **complex data** into **actionable insights**. **Cost-effectiveness planes** visualize ICERs, showing whether an intervention is cost-effective. **League tables** rank interventions by cost-effectiveness, while **net benefit analyses** quantify value in monetary terms. **Clear, transparent reporting** ensures stakeholders understand assumptions and limitations, aligning results with Malaysia’s **policy priorities** like equity or budget control. For the HPV vaccine, presenting the ICER relative to Malaysia’s GDP threshold informs whether to fund it, driving **policy action** rather than just academic analysis 📢.

## ⏰ 6. Time-Related Considerations

Time is a critical factor in **economic evaluation**, as the **timing** of costs and outcomes significantly impacts their perceived value. This section explores **time preference**, **discounting**, and **time horizon**, emphasizing their role in ensuring **fair comparisons** in Malaysia’s resource-constrained healthcare system 🌍. By addressing **when** costs and benefits occur, public health professionals can accurately assess interventions like cancer treatments or preventive programs, ensuring evaluations reflect **long-term impacts** and guide **efficient resource allocation** 🩺.

### 📖 Why Timing Matters

- **Time Preference**: People value **benefits now** more than later, necessitating adjustments for **future costs** and **outcomes**.

**Elaboration**: **Time preference** reflects the human tendency to prioritize **immediate benefits** over future ones, a principle rooted in economics. For example, a patient may value immediate relief from a treatment more than future health gains, and policymakers may prioritize current budget savings over long-term health improvements. In Malaysia’s healthcare context, this preference is critical when evaluating interventions like vaccinations, where costs are incurred now but benefits, such as reduced disease incidence, occur years later. Adjusting for **time preference** ensures evaluations are **realistic** and **relevant**, aligning with the priorities of stakeholders like the Ministry of Health or patients 📅.

### 📋 Discounting

- **Definition**: _A method to adjust future costs and outcomes to their present value._
- **When Applied**: Time horizons **exceeding 1 year**.
- **Purpose**: Ensures **fair comparison** between interventions with different **timing** of costs and benefits.
- **Standard Discount Rates**:

|**Context**|**Common Rate**|
|---|---|
|High-income settings (e.g., UK, US)|**3%** annually|
|LMIC guidelines / WHO|**3–5%**|
|Malaysian HTA (MaHTAS)|Often **3%** for costs and benefits|

- **Example**: Breast Cancer Case:

|**Metric**|**Without Discounting**|**With 3% Discounting**|
|---|---|---|
|Survival Gain|0.8 QALYs|~0.76 QALYs|
|Productivity Gains|RM 20,000|~RM 18,500|

- **Insight**: Discounting **reduces** future health and financial benefits.

**Elaboration**: **Discounting** converts **future costs** and **outcomes** to their **present value**, reflecting the **time value of money** and health benefits. This is essential for time horizons **exceeding 1 year**, as it ensures **fair comparisons** between interventions with different timing. For instance, a cancer treatment with high upfront costs but benefits over decades is compared equitably with a treatment offering immediate benefits. In Malaysia, the **3% discount rate** recommended by the Malaysian Health Technology Assessment Section (MaHTAS) is commonly used, aligning with **low- and middle-income country (LMIC)** guidelines (3–5%) and high-income settings like the UK or US (3%). The breast cancer example shows that a **3% discount rate** reduces a **0.8 QALY** survival gain to **~0.76 QALYs** and **RM 20,000** in productivity gains to **~RM 18,500**, highlighting how discounting **lowers the value** of future benefits. This step is crucial in Malaysia for evaluating **long-term interventions** like preventive vaccinations, ensuring **cost-effectiveness** reflects **present-day value** 🕰️.

### ⏳ Time Horizon

- **Definition**: _The length of time over which costs and outcomes are measured._
- **Choosing a Horizon**:

|**Scenario**|**Recommended Horizon**|
|---|---|
|Acute illness (e.g., influenza)|**1 year or less**|
|Chronic disease (e.g., cancer, diabetes)|**Lifetime** or **10–20 years**|
|Preventive intervention|Until **key outcomes** occur (e.g., cancer incidence avoided)|

- **Implications**: Breast Cancer Example:
    - **Short Horizon (1–2 years)**: Captures drug costs but misses survival gains.
    - **Lifetime Horizon**: Captures **reduced recurrence**, **survival**, and **return to work**.
    - **Risk**: Underestimating the horizon biases against **long-term interventions**.

**Elaboration**: The **time horizon** defines the **duration** over which an evaluation tracks **costs** and **outcomes**, directly affecting its **completeness**. For **acute illnesses** like influenza, a **1-year horizon** is sufficient, as costs and benefits occur quickly. For **chronic diseases** like cancer or diabetes, a **lifetime** or **10–20 year** horizon is needed to capture long-term effects like survival or complications. **Preventive interventions**, such as HPV vaccination, require a horizon extending until **key outcomes** (e.g., reduced cancer incidence) are realized, often decades later. In the breast cancer example, a **short horizon (1–2 years)** captures **drug costs** but misses **survival gains** or **reduced recurrence**, potentially undervaluing a targeted therapy. A **lifetime horizon** includes **long-term benefits** like extended survival and return to work, critical for assessing **cost-effectiveness** in Malaysia’s health system. The **risk** of a short horizon is **bias** against interventions with delayed benefits, such as preventive programs, which are vital for Malaysia’s public health strategy. Choosing an **appropriate horizon** ensures evaluations are **comprehensive** and **policy-relevant**, supporting decisions that maximize **health impact** 📊.

## 📈 7. Incremental Analysis and ICER

**Incremental analysis** is a cornerstone of **economic evaluation**, enabling decision-makers to compare the **additional costs** and **benefits** of one healthcare intervention over another. This section explores the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, its calculation, interpretation, and application in Malaysia’s resource-constrained healthcare system 🌍. By quantifying the **cost per additional unit of health benefit**, ICER guides policymakers in assessing whether interventions like new cancer drugs are worth the investment, ensuring **efficient** and **equitable** resource allocation 🩺.

### 📖 What is Incremental Analysis?

- **Definition**: _Compares the additional cost and benefit of one intervention versus another._
- **Question**: _“How much more are we paying for each additional unit of outcome?”_

**Elaboration**: **Incremental analysis** focuses on the **difference** in costs and outcomes between two interventions, such as a new drug versus standard care. This approach answers a critical question: **Is the extra cost justified by the extra benefit?** In Malaysia, where healthcare budgets are limited, this analysis is vital for prioritizing interventions that deliver the **greatest health impact** per ringgit spent. For example, comparing a new cancer therapy to an existing one involves assessing whether the additional cost leads to significant health gains, guiding decisions that balance **efficiency** and **patient outcomes** 📊.

### 🧮 ICER Formula

- **Formula**:  
    $$\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{New}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{Comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{New}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{Comparator}}}$$
    - **Numerator**: Incremental cost (RM).
    - **Denominator**: Incremental effectiveness (e.g., QALYs, life-years).

**Elaboration**: The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** quantifies the **additional cost** per **additional unit of health benefit** when choosing one intervention over another. The **numerator** represents the **difference in costs** (in Malaysian Ringgit, RM), while the **denominator** measures the **difference in effectiveness**, such as Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) or life-years gained. For instance, if a new drug costs RM 10,000 more but provides 0.5 additional QALYs, the ICER is calculated as $$\frac{10,000}{0.5} = \text{RM 20,000 per QALY}$$. In Malaysia, ICER is a key tool for **health technology assessments (HTA)**, helping policymakers determine whether the **extra cost** is worth the **health gain** in a resource-scarce environment 🧮.

### 📊 Example: HER2+ Breast Cancer

- **Data**:

|**Option**|**Cost (RM)**|**QALYs Gained**|
|---|---|---|
|Drug B (Standard)|20,000|1.5|
|Drug A (Targeted)|60,000|2.0|

- **Calculation**:  
    $$\text{ICER} = \frac{60,000 - 20,000}{2.0 - 1.5} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = \text{RM 80,000 per QALY}$$

**Elaboration**: This example applies **incremental analysis** to compare **Drug A** (a targeted therapy) versus **Drug B** (standard chemotherapy) for **HER2+ breast cancer**. The **incremental cost** is RM 60,000 - RM 20,000 = **RM 40,000**, and the **incremental effectiveness** is 2.0 QALYs - 1.5 QALYs = **0.5 QALYs**. Using the ICER formula, $$\text{ICER} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = \text{RM 80,000 per QALY}$$, this result indicates that adopting Drug A costs an additional **RM 80,000** for each QALY gained. In Malaysia, this ICER is compared to **thresholds** to determine **cost-effectiveness**, guiding decisions on whether to fund Drug A within the public health system’s budget constraints 🩺.

### 🔍 Interpreting ICER

- **Threshold Comparison**:
    - **ICER < Threshold**: Intervention is **cost-effective**.
    - **ICER > Threshold**: May not be cost-effective, depending on context.
- **Threshold Types**:

|**Type**|**Value (Approx.)**|
|---|---|
|GDP per capita (1×)|~RM 50,000/QALY|
|GDP per capita (3×)|~RM 150,000/QALY|
|MOH/HTA Implied WTP|RM 90,000–120,000/QALY|
|Opportunity Cost-Based|~RM 30,000–50,000/QALY|

- **Malaysia Context**:
    - **WHO-CHOICE**: <1× GDP (~~RM 50,000) = **highly cost-effective**; 1–3× (~~RM 50,000–150,000) = **cost-effective**.
    - **Critique**: GDP-based thresholds are **simplistic**, ignoring **budget constraints** and **opportunity costs**.
    - **Opportunity Cost-Based**: Reflects **health gains forgone** when diverting resources (more context-sensitive).

**Elaboration**: **Interpreting the ICER** involves comparing it to a **threshold**, which represents the **maximum amount** a health system or society is willing to pay for an additional unit of health benefit (e.g., 1 QALY). If the ICER is **below the threshold**, the intervention is deemed **cost-effective**; if **above**, it may not be, depending on factors like **disease severity** or **budget availability**. In Malaysia, thresholds include:

- **GDP-based thresholds** from WHO-CHOICE: An ICER below **RM 50,000/QALY** (1× GDP per capita) is **highly cost-effective**, while **RM 50,000–150,000/QALY** (1–3× GDP) is **cost-effective**. However, these are criticized for being **simplistic**, as they don’t account for **budget constraints** or **local priorities**.
- **MOH/HTA Implied Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)**: Malaysia’s Ministry of Health and HTA often use an informal range of **RM 90,000–120,000/QALY**, reflecting practical budgetary considerations.
- **Opportunity Cost-Based Thresholds**: Estimated at **RM 30,000–50,000/QALY**, these reflect the **health gains forgone** when resources are diverted, offering a **context-sensitive** measure for Malaysia’s health system.

For the HER2+ breast cancer case, an ICER of **RM 80,000/QALY** is **cost-effective** under the **MOH/HTA WTP threshold** (RM 90,000–120,000) but **borderline** under the **1× GDP threshold** (RM 50,000) and **not cost-effective** under **opportunity cost-based thresholds** (RM 30,000–50,000). This highlights the need for **context-specific interpretation** to guide **policy decisions** in Malaysia 📊.

### 📈 Cost-Effectiveness Plane

- **Quadrants**:
    - **NE (Northeast)**: More costly, more effective (evaluate ICER).
    - **SE (Southeast)**: Less costly, more effective (**adopt**).
    - **SW (Southwest)**: Less costly, less effective (evaluate trade-offs).
    - **NW (Northwest)**: More costly, less effective (**reject**).
- **Implication**: Drug A’s **RM 80,000/QALY** in the NE quadrant requires threshold comparison.

**Elaboration**: The **cost-effectiveness plane** is a visual tool that plots interventions based on their **incremental costs** (y-axis) and **incremental effectiveness** (x-axis), dividing outcomes into **four quadrants**:

- **Northeast (NE)**: The intervention is **more costly** and **more effective**, requiring ICER evaluation to determine if the extra cost is worth the benefit. Drug A’s **RM 80,000/QALY** falls here, prompting comparison with thresholds like Malaysia’s **RM 90,000–120,000/QALY**.
- **Southeast (SE)**: The intervention is **less costly** and **more effective**, making it a **dominant choice** that should be adopted. This is rare but ideal for cost-saving innovations 🌟.
- **Southwest (SW)**: The intervention is **less costly** but **less effective**, requiring trade-off evaluation to assess if cost savings justify reduced benefits.
- **Northwest (NW)**: The intervention is **more costly** and **less effective**, typically rejected as it offers no advantage.

In Malaysia, the **cost-effectiveness plane** helps policymakers visualize trade-offs, ensuring decisions align with **budget constraints** and **health priorities**. For Drug A, its position in the **NE quadrant** necessitates careful threshold analysis to justify funding 📈.

### 📊 Mini Case: Colorectal Cancer Drug

- **Data**:

|**Option**|**Cost (RM)**|**QALYs Gained**|
|---|---|---|
|Standard Care|20,000|1.5|
|New Drug|60,000|2.0|

- **ICER**: RM 80,000/QALY.
- **Interpretation**:
    - **WTP Threshold (RM 100,000)**: **Cost-effective**.
    - **GDP Threshold (RM 50,000)**: **Borderline/not cost-effective**.
    - **Opportunity Cost (RM 30,000–40,000)**: **Not cost-effective**.

**Elaboration**: This **mini case** applies **incremental analysis** to a colorectal cancer drug scenario in Malaysia. The **new drug** costs **RM 60,000** and yields **2.0 QALYs**, compared to **standard care** at **RM 20,000** and **1.5 QALYs**. The ICER is calculated as:  
$$\text{ICER} = \frac{60,000 - 20,000}{2.0 - 1.5} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = \text{RM 80,000 per QALY}$$  
The **interpretation** depends on the threshold:

- **WTP Threshold (RM 100,000)**: The new drug is **cost-effective**, as its ICER is below the MOH/HTA implied threshold, suggesting it’s a viable investment for Malaysia’s health system.
- **GDP Threshold (RM 50,000)**: The ICER is **borderline or not cost-effective**, as it exceeds the 1× GDP per capita threshold, highlighting the limitations of GDP-based metrics.
- **Opportunity Cost (RM 30,000–40,000)**: The ICER is **not cost-effective**, as it exceeds the health gains forgone when diverting resources, emphasizing **budget constraints**.

This case underscores the importance of **context-sensitive thresholds** in Malaysia, where **disease severity**, **budget availability**, and **equity** influence whether the new drug is prioritized 🩺.

### 📖 Why Sensitivity Analysis?

- **Purpose**: Tests **robustness** of results under **uncertainty** in parameters (e.g., costs, utilities, effects).
- **Rationale**: Real-world data are **imperfect**, relying on **assumptions** and **estimates**.
- **Question**: _“How much would our conclusion change if the numbers change?”_

**Elaboration**: **Sensitivity analysis** addresses the inherent **uncertainty** in economic evaluations, as real-world data, such as drug costs or health outcomes, often rely on **estimates** or **assumptions** that may vary. Its **purpose** is to test whether evaluation results remain **reliable** when key inputs change, ensuring **robust conclusions**. In Malaysia, where healthcare decisions must balance **budget constraints** with **health outcomes**, sensitivity analysis answers the critical question: **How sensitive are our findings to changes in data?** For example, if a new drug’s price fluctuates or its effectiveness is uncertain, sensitivity analysis reveals whether the intervention remains **cost-effective**, providing policymakers with **confidence** in funding decisions 📊.

### 📋 Types of Sensitivity Analysis

The table below outlines the **five types** of sensitivity analysis, their descriptions, and examples in the context of a breast cancer evaluation:

|**Type**|**Description**|**Example (Breast Cancer)**|
|---|---|---|
|**One-Way (Univariate)**|Vary one parameter at a time|Vary Drug A cost from RM 60,000 to RM 40,000|
|**Multi-Way**|Vary multiple parameters simultaneously|Vary drug cost and utility score|
|**Scenario Analysis**|Test plausible real-world scenarios|Assume public vs. private provision costs|
|**Probabilistic (PSA)**|Assign distributions; use Monte Carlo simulation|1,000 simulations of cost, utility values|
|**Threshold Analysis**|Determine value where result changes|At what price is Drug A no longer cost-effective?|

**Elaboration**:

- **One-Way (Univariate) Analysis**: Tests the impact of changing **one parameter** at a time, such as varying the cost of Drug A from **RM 60,000** to **RM 40,000**. This isolates the effect of a single variable, making it simple and useful for identifying **key drivers** in Malaysia’s cost-sensitive health system 📏.
- **Multi-Way Analysis**: Simultaneously varies **multiple parameters**, like drug cost and utility score, to explore combined effects. This is more realistic, as real-world uncertainties often involve multiple factors, such as fluctuating prices and patient outcomes in Malaysia’s hospitals 📈.

- **Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA)**: Uses **Monte Carlo simulations** to assign **probability distributions** to parameters, running thousands of scenarios (e.g., 1,000 simulations of costs and utilities). This provides a **range of possible outcomes**, enhancing **confidence** in results for complex interventions like cancer therapies 🧮.
- **Threshold Analysis**: Identifies the **critical value** at which a result changes, such as the maximum price for Drug A to remain cost-effective. In Malaysia, this helps negotiate drug prices or set **budget limits**, ensuring **policy relevance** 💡.
- **Key Insight**: These methods address different aspects of **uncertainty**, allowing evaluators to tailor analyses to Malaysia’s healthcare needs, from **budget planning** to **patient-centered care**.

### 📈 Example: Breast Cancer Drug A vs. B

- **Base ICER**: RM 80,000/QALY.
- **One-Way Analysis**:
    - If Drug A price drops to **RM 45,000**: ICER = **RM 50,000/QALY** → **Cost-effective**.
    - If utility is **0.7** instead of **0.8**: ICER increases → **Less cost-effective**.
- **Threshold Analysis**: What’s the **maximum price** for Drug A to stay below **RM 100,000/QALY**?

**Elaboration**: This example applies **sensitivity analysis** to the comparison of **Drug A** (targeted therapy) versus **Drug B** (standard chemotherapy) for **HER2+ breast cancer**, with a **base ICER** of **RM 80,000/QALY**. **One-way analysis** tests individual parameters:

- Reducing Drug A’s price to **RM 45,000** lowers the ICER to **RM 50,000/QALY**, making it **cost-effective** under Malaysia’s **1× GDP threshold** (~RM 50,000/QALY) and **MOH/HTA WTP threshold** (RM 90,000–120,000/QALY).
- Lowering the utility score from **0.8** to **0.7** (reflecting worse quality of life) increases the ICER, making Drug A **less cost-effective**, as fewer QALYs are gained.

**Threshold analysis** determines the **maximum price** at which Drug A’s ICER remains below **RM 100,000/QALY**, guiding price negotiations in Malaysia’s health system. This example shows how **sensitivity analysis** identifies **key drivers** (e.g., drug price, utility) and ensures **robust results**, critical for decisions on high-cost interventions like cancer drugs 🩺.

### 📊 Tornado Diagram

    - **Example**: Choosing between **Drug A** and **Drug B** for a **6-month adjuvant treatment**.
2. **Markov Model**:
    - **Use**: Chronic conditions or recurrent events.
    - **Structure**: Patients transition between **health states** (e.g., well, recurrence, dead) in **cycles** (e.g., yearly).
    - **Example**: Modeling breast cancer transitions: **Well → Local recurrence → Metastasis → Death**.

**Elaboration**:

- **Decision Tree**: Ideal for **short-term, one-time decisions**, such as choosing between two treatments for a **6-month adjuvant therapy** in breast cancer. The **branches** represent possible **choices** (e.g., Drug A or B) and **outcomes** (e.g., remission, side effects), making it **simple** and **intuitive**. In Malaysia, decision trees are used for acute interventions or short-term evaluations, like surgical procedures, due to their clarity and ease of use 🌳.
- **Markov Model**: Suited for **chronic conditions** or **recurrent events**, like breast cancer, where patients move through **health states** (e.g., well, recurrence, metastasis, death) over **cycles** (e.g., yearly). This captures the **dynamic nature** of diseases, critical for Malaysia’s evaluations of long-term interventions like cancer therapies or diabetes management 🔄.
- **Key Insight**: The choice of model depends on the **timeframe** and **complexity** of the intervention, with **decision trees** for short-term clarity and **Markov models** for long-term, complex scenarios in Malaysia’s healthcare system.

### 🔍 Key Components of a Markov Model

- **States**: Mutually exclusive (e.g., stable, recurrence, death).
- **Cycles**: Time steps (e.g., yearly).
- **Transition Probabilities**: Likelihood of moving between states.
- **Utilities and Costs**: Assigned to each state per cycle.

**Elaboration**: A **Markov model** is structured around **key components** to simulate patient journeys in chronic conditions:

- **States**: Represent **mutually exclusive health conditions**, such as **stable**, **recurrence**, or **death** in breast cancer. Each patient occupies one state at a time, ensuring clarity in modeling disease progression 🩺.
- **Cycles**: Divide time into **discrete steps** (e.g., yearly), allowing the model to track changes over time. In Malaysia, yearly cycles are common for chronic disease evaluations to align with healthcare planning 📅.
- **Transition Probabilities**: Quantify the **likelihood** of moving between states, such as the probability of progressing from **stable** to **recurrence**. These are derived from clinical data or literature, critical for accuracy in Malaysia’s context 📊.
- **Utilities and Costs**: Assign **health utilities** (e.g., QALYs) and **costs** to each state per cycle, reflecting quality of life and resource use. For example, the **stable** state may have high QALYs and low costs, while **recurrence** incurs higher costs and lower utilities 💰.
- **Application**: In Malaysia, Markov models are used to evaluate **chronic diseases** like cancer, ensuring **long-term costs** and **outcomes** are captured for **policy-relevant** decisions.

### 🌟 Advantages of Modeling

## 📚 10. Case Study: HER2+ Breast Cancer

This case study applies the principles of **economic evaluation** to a real-world scenario, comparing **Drug A** (a new targeted therapy) versus **Drug B** (standard chemotherapy) for women with **early-stage HER2+ breast cancer**. This section illustrates how to conduct a **full economic evaluation**, integrating **costing**, **outcome measurement**, **incremental analysis**, and **threshold comparison** to inform **policy decisions** in Malaysia’s resource-constrained healthcare system 🌍. By analyzing **costs**, **outcomes**, and **cost-effectiveness**, this case study highlights the practical application of economic evaluation in prioritizing **high-impact interventions** while addressing **budget constraints** and **equity** concerns 🩺.

### 📖 Scenario

- **Context**: Comparing **Drug A** (new targeted therapy) vs. **Drug B** (standard chemotherapy) for women with **early-stage HER2+ breast cancer**.
- **Parameters**:
    - **Target Population**: Women with early-stage HER2+ breast cancer.
    - **Perspective**: Health system.
    - **Time Horizon**: 5 years.
    - **Discount Rate**: **3%** (simplified for illustration).

**Elaboration**: This **scenario** focuses on a critical decision for Malaysia’s healthcare system: whether to adopt **Drug A**, a new targeted therapy, over **Drug B**, the standard chemotherapy, for women with **early-stage HER2+ breast cancer**, a condition with significant health and economic implications. The **target population** is clearly defined to ensure the evaluation is relevant to a specific group, aligning with clinical needs. The **health system perspective** focuses on **direct medical costs** (e.g., drug acquisition, hospital stays), reflecting the priorities of Malaysia’s Ministry of Health in managing public healthcare budgets. A **5-year time horizon** captures medium-term costs and outcomes, such as survival and quality of life, while the **3% discount rate** adjusts future values to their present worth, aligning with Malaysia’s Health Technology Assessment (HTA) guidelines. This scenario sets the stage for a **systematic evaluation**, demonstrating how economic tools guide **policy-relevant** decisions in Malaysia 💉.

### 📊 Input Data

The table below presents the **input data** for the economic evaluation of Drug A and Drug B:

|**Intervention**|**Cost (RM)**|**QALYs Gained**|
|---|---|---|
|Drug B (Standard)|20,000|1.5|
|Drug A (New)|60,000|2.0|

**Elaboration**: The **input data** provide the foundation for comparing **Drug A** and **Drug B**. **Costs** are measured in Malaysian Ringgit (RM), with **Drug B** costing **RM 20,000** and **Drug A** costing **RM 60,000**, reflecting the higher expense of targeted therapies. **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** measure health outcomes, with **Drug B** yielding **1.5 QALYs** and **Drug A** yielding **2.0 QALYs**, indicating better survival and quality of life with the new therapy. These data, derived from clinical trials or costing studies, are critical for Malaysia’s **health system perspective**, ensuring the evaluation reflects **real-world costs** and **health benefits**. Accurate inputs are essential for **credible results**, guiding decisions on whether to fund a costly intervention like Drug A 📊.

### 🧮 Calculations

- **Incremental Cost**:  
    $$\text{Cost}_A - \text{Cost}_B = 60,000 - 20,000 = \text{RM 40,000}$$
- **Incremental QALYs**:  
    $$2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5 \text{ QALYs}$$
- **ICER**:  
    $$\text{ICER} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = \text{RM 80,000 per QALY}$$

**Elaboration**: The **calculations** apply **incremental analysis** to quantify the **additional cost** and **benefit** of Drug A over Drug B:

- **Incremental Cost**: Subtracting Drug B’s cost (RM 20,000) from Drug A’s cost (RM 60,000) yields $$\text{RM 60,000 - 20,000 = RM 40,000}$$, representing the **extra cost** of adopting Drug A.
- **Incremental QALYs**: Subtracting Drug B’s QALYs (1.5) from Drug A’s QALYs (2.0) gives $$2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5 \text{ QALYs}$$, indicating the **additional health benefit** of Drug A.
- **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**: Dividing the incremental cost by the incremental QALYs, $$\text{ICER} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = \text{RM 80,000 per QALY}$$, shows the **cost per additional QALY** gained by choosing Drug A.

These calculations are critical in Malaysia, where the **ICER** helps policymakers assess whether the **RM 80,000 per QALY** is worth the investment, balancing **health gains** with **budget constraints** 🧮.

### 📈 Interpretation

- **Thresholds**:
    - **WTP (RM 100,000/QALY)**: Drug A is **cost-effective**.
    - **GDP (RM 50,000/QALY)**: Drug A is **not cost-effective**.
    - **Opportunity Cost (RM 30,000–50,000/QALY)**: Drug A is **not cost-effective**.
- **Decision Factors**:
    - **Budget constraints**.
    - **Disease severity**.
    - **Equity considerations** (e.g., access for low-income patients).

**Elaboration**: The **interpretation** of the ICER (**RM 80,000/QALY**) involves comparing it to **thresholds** that reflect Malaysia’s willingness to pay for health gains:

- **WTP Threshold (RM 100,000/QALY)**: Drug A’s ICER of **RM 80,000/QALY** is below the **Ministry of Health/HTA implied willingness-to-pay (WTP)** threshold (RM 90,000–120,000/QALY), making it **cost-effective**. This suggests Drug A is a viable investment for Malaysia’s public health system, offering significant health benefits within acceptable cost limits 🌟.
- **GDP Threshold (RM 50,000/QALY)**: Based on WHO-CHOICE’s 1× GDP per capita threshold (~RM 50,000/QALY), Drug A is **not cost-effective**, as its ICER exceeds this limit. This highlights the **simplistic nature** of GDP-based thresholds, which may not account for Malaysia’s specific **budget constraints** or **health priorities**.
- **Opportunity Cost Threshold (RM 30,000–50,000/QALY)**: Reflecting the **health gains forgone** when diverting resources, this threshold deems Drug A **not cost-effective**, as its ICER exceeds the range. This is critical in Malaysia, where **scarce resources** require prioritizing interventions with lower opportunity costs 📉.

**Decision Factors** influence the final recommendation:

- **Budget Constraints**: Malaysia’s limited healthcare budget may restrict funding for costly interventions like Drug A, despite its cost-effectiveness under the WTP threshold.
- **Disease Severity**: The life-threatening nature of HER2+ breast cancer may justify higher costs, as improved survival and quality of life are critical.
- **Equity Considerations**: Ensuring **access for low-income patients** is vital in Malaysia, where out-of-pocket costs can exacerbate **financial toxicity**. A **health system perspective** may overlook these, but **equity** could tip the decision toward funding Drug A if it addresses unmet needs.

This interpretation underscores the need for **context-sensitive analysis** in Malaysia, balancing **cost-effectiveness**, **health priorities**, and **equity** to guide **policy decisions** 📊.

**Elaboration**: A **robust economic evaluation** is one that is **systematic**, **transparent**, and **relevant** to decision-makers, providing a reliable basis for allocating Malaysia’s limited healthcare resources. Errors in methodology or reporting can lead to **misleading conclusions**, reducing trust in evaluations and potentially misguiding **policy decisions**. For example, an evaluation of a new vaccine program in Malaysia must be clear and accurate to justify funding over other priorities. This section highlights **seven common mistakes**, offering insights and examples to help students avoid them, ensuring evaluations are **credible** and **impactful** 📋.

### 📋 Seven Common Mistakes

The table below summarizes the **seven common mistakes** in economic evaluation, their importance, pitfalls, and examples, providing a quick reference for avoiding errors:

|**Mistake**|**Why It Matters**|**Pitfall**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Inappropriate/Unstated Perspective|Determines **cost** and **outcome** inclusion|Using a **narrow perspective** when **societal impact** is relevant|Ignoring **OOP costs** in a cancer care study for low-income populations|
|Incorrect/Inconsistent Costing|Accurate costing is the **foundation**|Using **outdated prices**, not adjusting for **inflation**, or mixing **price sources**|Using **private hospital rates** in a **public sector** evaluation|
|Inadequate Time Horizon|Short horizons miss **long-term benefits** or **harms**|Limiting to **trial duration** for chronic conditions|**1-year horizon** for breast cancer, missing **10-year recurrence risk**|
|No Discounting|**Time preference** must be accounted for|Ignoring discounting for horizons **exceeding 1 year**|Reporting **lifetime QALYs** without a **discount rate**|
|Missing/Weak Sensitivity Analysis|**Uncertainty** requires robust testing|No analysis or testing **trivial variables**|Not testing **utility score variations** for high-impact side effects|
|No Incremental Comparison/ICER Misuse|**ICER** is core to decision-making|Reporting **total cost** and **QALYs** without comparing alternatives|Stating “Drug A yields 2 QALYs at RM 70,000” without comparing Drug B|
|Lack of Transparency/Reproducibility|Policymakers need clear **assumptions**|Unclear reporting of **data sources**, **model assumptions**, or **methods**|Using a **Markov model** without showing **transition probabilities** or **utility weights**|

#### 1. Inappropriate or Unstated Perspective

- **Why It Matters**: Perspective determines **cost** and **outcome** inclusion.
- **Pitfall**: Using a **narrow perspective** (e.g., provider) when **societal impact** is relevant.
- **Example**: Ignoring **OOP costs** in a cancer care study for low-income populations.

**Elaboration**: The **perspective** defines which **costs** (e.g., drugs, travel) and **outcomes** (e.g., survival, productivity) are included, directly shaping the evaluation’s scope. Choosing an **inappropriate perspective**, such as a **provider perspective** when **societal impacts** like patient out-of-pocket (OOP) costs are critical, can skew results. For instance, ignoring **OOP costs** in a cancer care study for Malaysia’s low-income populations overlooks **financial toxicity**, undermining **equity considerations**. Similarly, failing to state the perspective reduces **transparency**, confusing policymakers. In Malaysia, where **equity** and **access** are priorities, clearly defining and justifying the perspective ensures evaluations align with **stakeholder needs** 👁️.

#### 2. Incorrect or Inconsistent Costing

- **Why It Matters**: Accurate costing is the **foundation** of evaluation.
- **Pitfall**: Using **outdated prices**, not adjusting for **inflation**, or mixing **price sources**.
- **Example**: Using **private hospital rates** in a **public sector** evaluation.

**Elaboration**: **Accurate costing** is essential for credible evaluations, as it reflects the **true resource use** of interventions. Errors like using **outdated prices**, failing to adjust for **inflation**, or mixing **price sources** (e.g., private vs. public rates) can lead to **inconsistent** or **misleading** cost estimates. For example, applying **private hospital rates** in a **public sector** evaluation in Malaysia overstates costs, as public hospitals use standardized tariffs. This can distort the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, leading to poor policy decisions. In Malaysia’s cost-sensitive health system, consistent use of **local data** (e.g., Ministry of Health fee schedules) ensures evaluations are **reliable** and **policy-relevant** 💰.

#### 3. Inadequate Time Horizon

- **Why It Matters**: Short horizons miss **long-term benefits** or **harms**.
- **Pitfall**: Limiting analysis to **trial duration** for chronic conditions.
- **Example**: **1-year horizon** for breast cancer, missing **10-year recurrence risk**.

**Elaboration**: The **time horizon** determines how far into the future **costs** and **outcomes** are tracked, and an **inadequate horizon** can miss critical impacts. For chronic conditions like breast cancer, limiting the analysis to a **1-year horizon** (e.g., trial duration) captures immediate costs but misses **long-term benefits** like reduced recurrence or **harms** like late side effects. In Malaysia, where **chronic diseases** strain healthcare budgets, a **lifetime horizon** is often needed to fully assess interventions like cancer therapies. An inadequate horizon biases against **long-term interventions**, such as preventive programs, reducing their perceived value and undermining **policy decisions** ⏰.

#### 4. No Discounting of Future Costs/Benefits

- **Why It Matters**: **Time preference** must be accounted for in long-term evaluations.
- **Pitfall**: Ignoring discounting for horizons **exceeding 1 year**.
- **Example**: Reporting **lifetime QALYs** without a **discount rate**.

**Elaboration**: **Discounting** adjusts **future costs** and **outcomes** to their **present value**, reflecting **time preference** (valuing benefits now over later). Failing to apply discounting for horizons **exceeding 1 year**, as required in Malaysia’s HTA guidelines (typically **3%**), overstates future benefits like **lifetime QALYs**. For example, reporting QALYs for a cancer treatment without a **discount rate** inflates its value, leading to **misinformed decisions**. In Malaysia, where **long-term interventions** like vaccinations are common, discounting ensures **fair comparisons** between immediate and future benefits, aligning with **budget constraints** 🕰️.

#### 5. Missing or Weak Sensitivity Analysis

- **Why It Matters**: **Uncertainty** requires robust testing.
- **Pitfall**: No analysis or testing **trivial variables**.
- **Example**: Not testing **utility score variations** for high-impact side effects.

**Elaboration**: **Sensitivity analysis** tests the **robustness** of results under **uncertainty** in parameters like costs or utilities. Missing or conducting **weak sensitivity analysis**—e.g., testing only **trivial variables**—fails to address critical uncertainties, reducing **confidence** in findings. For instance, not testing **utility score variations** for side effects in a cancer drug evaluation ignores their impact on **quality of life**, potentially misrepresenting **cost-effectiveness**. In Malaysia, where data uncertainties (e.g., fluctuating drug prices) are common, robust sensitivity analysis ensures **reliable recommendations**, supporting **transparent decision-making** 🔬.

#### 6. No Incremental Comparison or ICER Misuse

- **Why It Matters**: **ICER** is core to decision-making.
- **Pitfall**: Reporting **total cost** and **QALYs** without comparing alternatives.
- **Example**: Stating “Drug A yields 2 QALYs at RM 70,000” without comparing Drug B.

**Elaboration**: The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** compares the **additional cost** and **benefit** of one intervention over another, making it central to **decision-making**. Failing to perform **incremental comparison** or misusing ICER by reporting only **total costs** and **QALYs** (e.g., “Drug A yields 2 QALYs at RM 70,000”) without comparing to Drug B obscures **relative value**. In Malaysia, where policymakers need to choose between competing interventions, ICER ensures **cost-effectiveness** is assessed relative to alternatives, guiding **resource allocation** for interventions like new drugs 📈.

#### 7. Lack of Transparency or Reproducibility

- **Why It Matters**: Policymakers need clear **assumptions**.
- **Pitfall**: Unclear reporting of **data sources**, **model assumptions**, or **methods**.
- **Example**: Using a **Markov model** without showing **transition probabilities** or **utility weights**.

**Elaboration**: **Transparency** and **reproducibility** are essential for building **stakeholder trust**, as policymakers in Malaysia rely on clear **assumptions** to validate evaluations. Unclear reporting of **data sources**, **model assumptions**, or **methods**—such as using a **Markov model** without documenting **transition probabilities** or **utility weights**—reduces **credibility** and makes results difficult to verify. For example, a cancer treatment evaluation in Malaysia must clearly state data sources (e.g., hospital records) and model details to ensure **reproducibility**. Transparent reporting aligns evaluations with **policy needs**, fostering trust in **HTA processes** 📑.
