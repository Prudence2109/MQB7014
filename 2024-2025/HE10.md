## 🩺 2. Recap of Economic Evaluation Basics

### 📖 What is Economic Evaluation?
- **Definition**: *“A comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences.”*  
  - **Source**: Drummond et al. (2005).
- **Core Idea**: Economic evaluation helps decision-makers allocate **limited resources** efficiently by evaluating both **costs** and **outcomes** 💰.

### 📊 Types of Economic Evaluation
| **Type** | **Outcome Measure**            | **Decision Focus**                              |
|----------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **CMA**  | Same outcomes                  | Which is cheaper?                               |
| **CEA**  | Natural units (e.g., life-years gained) | Which gives more health for the cost?           |
| **CUA**  | Utility-based (e.g., QALYs, DALYs) | Which gives more value considering quality of life? |
| **CBA**  | Money (e.g., RM)               | Do monetary benefits exceed costs?              |
- **Note**: **Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)** is rarely used unless **equivalency of outcomes** is proven.

### 🧠 Key Economic Principles
- **Scarcity**: Resources are **limited**, necessitating **choices** 📉.
- **Opportunity Cost**: The **value** of the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made 💸.
- **Efficiency**: Maximizing **health outcomes** per unit of resource 🌟.
- **Marginal Analysis**: Evaluating the **incremental cost** and **effect** of a change in resource use 📈.

### 👁️ Importance of Perspective
- **Definition**: *Perspective defines whose costs and benefits are counted in an evaluation.*
- **Impact**: Different perspectives yield **different conclusions** for the same intervention.
- **Common Perspectives**:

| **Perspective**      | **Costs Included**                     | **Common Use**                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Societal**         | All costs (direct, indirect, intangible) | Academics, global health agencies     |
| **Health System/Provider** | Direct medical costs only       | Ministries of Health, HTA bodies      |
| **Payer**            | Reimbursed/claimable medical expenses  | Insurance schemes, MySalam, employers |
| **Patient**          | Out-of-pocket costs, lost income       | Advocacy groups, equity researchers   |

## 📋 3. Steps in Conducting a Full Economic Evaluation

A **full economic evaluation** systematically compares **two or more interventions** to inform **resource allocation**. The process involves **10 key steps**, each critical for ensuring **methodological rigor** and **policy relevance**.

### 🔍 Step 1: Define the Problem and Comparators
- **Objective**: Clearly state the **health issue** or **policy question** and identify **interventions** to compare.
- **Requirements**:
  - Interventions must be **clinically relevant** and **feasible**.
  - Comparators can include **new treatment** vs. **standard care** or **no intervention**.
- **Example**: Should Malaysia’s Ministry of Health adopt a new **HPV vaccine** for boys alongside girls? 💉

### 👁️ Step 2: Choose the Perspective
- **Purpose**: Determines which **costs** and **benefits** are included in the analysis.
- **Common Perspectives**:
  - **Societal**: All costs and outcomes (direct, indirect, intangible).
  - **Health System**: Direct medical costs (e.g., drugs, hospital stays).
  - **Payer**: Reimbursed costs (e.g., insurance claims).
  - **Patient**: Out-of-pocket costs and productivity losses.
- **Impact**: Perspective affects the **interpretation of value** (e.g., societal may favor interventions with productivity gains, while health system may prioritize budget impact).

### ⏰ Step 3: Set the Time Horizon
- **Definition**: The **duration** over which **costs** and **outcomes** are measured.
- **Considerations**:
  - Must be **long enough** to capture **meaningful effects**.
  - **Short-term** (e.g., 1 year) for acute conditions.
  - **Long-term** (e.g., lifetime) for chronic diseases.
- **Risk**: A **short horizon** may miss **delayed benefits** or **costs**.
- **Example**: A **5-year horizon** for a mobile dental clinic may capture initial costs but miss long-term oral health gains.

### 💰 Step 4: Identify, Measure, and Value Costs
- **Types of Costs**:
  - **Direct Medical**: Hospital stays, drugs, staff time 🩺.
  - **Direct Non-Medical**: Transport, caregiving 🚗.
  - **Indirect**: Lost productivity due to illness or treatment 💼.
  - **Intangible**: Pain, anxiety (rarely quantified) 😟.
- **Process**:
  - Use **real-world data**, **costing studies**, or **tariffs** to ensure accuracy.
  - Align costs with the chosen **perspective**.
- **Importance**: Accurate cost data is **essential** for credible evaluations.

### 📈 Step 5: Identify and Measure Outcomes
- **Types**:
  - **Natural Units**: Cases detected, life-years gained (for CEA).
  - **Utility-Based**: QALYs, DALYs (for CUA).
  - **Monetary**: RM value (for CBA).
- **Requirements**:
  - Outcomes must be **meaningful**, **measurable**, and **valid**.
  - Choice of outcome determines the **evaluation type** (CEA, CUA, CBA).

### ⏳ Step 6: Apply Discounting (If Needed)
- **Definition**: *Adjusting future costs and outcomes to their present value to reflect time preference (value now > value later).*
- **When Applied**: For **time horizons** exceeding **1 year**.
- **Common Discount Rates**: **3–5%** annually.
- **Purpose**: Ensures **fair comparison** between interventions with different timing of costs and benefits.
- **Example**: A **3% discount rate** reduces future QALYs and costs in long-term interventions like cancer treatment.

### 📊 Step 7: Conduct Incremental Analysis
- **Definition**: *Compares the additional cost and benefit of one intervention versus another.*
- **Tool**: **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**:
  $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_A - \text{Cost}_B}{\text{Effect}_A - \text{Effect}_B} $$
  - **Numerator**: Incremental cost (RM).
  - **Denominator**: Incremental effectiveness (e.g., QALYs, life-years).
- **Interpretation**: Compare ICER against **thresholds** (e.g., willingness-to-pay, GDP-based, or opportunity cost-based).
- **Purpose**: Determines if the **extra cost** is worth the **extra benefit**.

### 🔬 Step 8: Perform Sensitivity Analysis
- **Purpose**: Tests how **results change** under **uncertainty** in parameters (e.g., costs, outcomes).
- **Types**:
  - **One-Way**: Vary one parameter at a time.
  - **Multi-Way**: Vary multiple parameters simultaneously.
  - **Probabilistic**: Use Monte Carlo simulations with parameter distributions.
- **Benefits**:
  - Identifies **key drivers** of cost-effectiveness.
  - Enhances **confidence** in conclusions by assessing robustness.

### 🧮 Step 9: Use Modeling (If Applicable)
- **Purpose**: Simulates **complex** or **long-term** scenarios where direct data are limited.
- **Tools**:
  - **Decision Trees**: For short-term, one-time decisions.
  - **Markov Models**: For chronic or recurring conditions.
- **Role**: Bridges **data gaps**, supports **extrapolation**, and incorporates **uncertainty**.

### 📜 Step 10: Interpret and Present Results
- **Methods**:
  - Use **cost-effectiveness planes**, **league tables**, or **net benefit** analyses.
  - Report **clearly**, **transparently**, and with **context**.
- **Alignment**: Results must align with **policy priorities** and **resource constraints**.
- **Goal**: Inform **action**, not just analysis.

## 💰 4. Costing in Economic Evaluation

### 📖 What is Cost?
- **Definition**: *The value of resources consumed to deliver an intervention or service.*
- **Importance**: Systematic **identification**, **measurement**, and **valuation** of costs ensure accurate reflection of **resource use** from the chosen perspective.

### 📋 Types of Costs
| **Cost Type** | **Description** | **Medical Example** |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Direct Medical** | Costs incurred by the health system/provider | Chemotherapy drugs, oncologist fees, infusion room, lab tests |
| **Direct Non-Medical** | Non-medical expenses due to seeking care | Patient travel to oncology center, parking, accommodation |
| **Indirect** | Productivity losses due to illness/treatment | Sick leave during chemo cycles, early retirement due to fatigue |
| **Intangible** | Non-financial costs hard to quantify | Anxiety, pain, hair loss stigma, emotional distress |

### 🔍 Costing Process: 3 Steps
1. **Identification**:
   - **What resources** are used?
   - List all relevant **resource items** for both **intervention** and **comparator**.
   - **Example**: Number of **chemo sessions**, **blood tests**, **clinic visits**.
2. **Measurement**:
   - **How much** was used?
   - Quantify **resource use** (e.g., number of visits, days hospitalized).
   - **Data Sources**: Patient records, surveys, administrative databases.
   - **Example**: **6 chemo cycles**, **12 blood tests**.
3. **Valuation**:
   - Assign a **monetary value** to each resource unit.
   - **Example**: RM 1,500 per chemo cycle, RM 80 per lab test, RM 50 per outpatient visit.
   - **Sources**: Fee schedules, Diagnostic-Related Group (DRG) tariffs, market prices, published cost studies.

### 📊 Micro-Costing vs. Gross-Costing
| **Approach** | **Description** | **Use When** |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Micro-Costing** | Itemize and value each resource in detail | High precision needed (e.g., alongside clinical trials) |
| **Gross-Costing** | Use average cost per service unit | Budget planning, secondary data |
- **Micro-Costing**: More **precise** but **time-consuming**.
- **Gross-Costing**: **Quicker** but **less detailed**.

### 📈 Example: Breast Cancer Treatment
- **Policy Question**: Is **Drug A** (new monoclonal antibody) more cost-effective than **Drug B** (standard chemotherapy) for HER2+ breast cancer?
- **Costs to Include**:
  - **Drug Acquisition**: RM 5,000 vs. RM 1,200 per cycle.
  - **Pre-Medication & Monitoring Labs**.
  - **Side Effect Management**: E.g., febrile neutropenia admission.
  - **Patient Travel & Lost Income**: If using **societal** or **patient** perspective.
- **Key Insight**: Accurate costing requires understanding **what**, **how much**, **at what price**, and **whose perspective** counts.

### 👁️ Perspective-Specific Costs
- **HER2+ Breast Cancer Example**:

| **Cost Item** | **Included in Perspective** |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Drug price (RM per cycle) | All perspectives |
| Blood tests, infusion costs | Provider, Payer, Societal |
| Travel to cancer center | Patient, Societal |
| Lost income from work | Patient, Societal |

- **Implications**:

| **Perspective** | **ICER Interpretation** |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Societal** | High drug cost offset by return to work → **Cost-effective** |
| **Health System** | Costly without budget impact benefit → **Not cost-effective** |
| **Patient** | High OOP costs → **Financially toxic** |
| **Payer** | High reimbursement burden → **Low priority** |

## 📊 5. Measuring Outcomes

### 📖 What are Outcomes?
- **Definition**: *The consequences of an intervention on health.*
- **Measurement**: Varies by **evaluation type** (CEA, CUA, CBA).

### 📋 Types of Outcome Measures
| **Outcome Type** | **Used In** | **Example** |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Natural Units** | CEA | Life-years gained, cases detected |
| **Utility-Based** | CUA | QALYs, DALYs |
| **Monetary** | CBA | RM value of productivity |

### 📈 Breast Cancer Case: Outcome Examples
- **Comparing Drug A (targeted therapy) vs. Drug B (standard chemotherapy)**:

| **Evaluation** | **Outcome Used** | **Why It Matters** |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **CEA** | Life-years gained | Drug A improves survival by 8 months |
| **CUA** | QALYs | Drug A improves survival with fewer side effects, enhancing quality of life |
| **CBA** | RM value of productivity | Drug A allows earlier return to work |

### 🧠 Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY)
- **Definition**: *Combines length of life and quality of life on a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).*
- **Examples**:
  - 1 year at **full health** = **1 QALY**.
  - 1 year with **side effects** (utility = 0.6) = **0.6 QALYs**.
- **Use Case**: CUA, especially when **quality of life** is significantly affected (e.g., chemotherapy vs. targeted therapy).

### 🔍 Measuring Utilities
| **Method**          | **Description**                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **EQ-5D**           | Standardized tool for health states     |
| **Time Trade-Off**  | Time willing to trade for better health |
| **Standard Gamble** | Risk willing to accept for full health  |
- **Sources**: Published **utility weights** or **patient-collected data**.

---

## ⏰ 6. Time-Related Considerations

### 📖 Why Timing Matters
- **Time Preference**: People value **benefits now** more than later, necessitating adjustments for **future costs** and **outcomes**.

### 📋 Discounting
- **Definition**: *A method to adjust future costs and outcomes to their present value.*
- **When Applied**: Time horizons **exceeding 1 year**.
- **Purpose**: Ensures **fair comparison** between interventions with different **timing** of costs and benefits.
- **Standard Discount Rates**:

| **Context** | **Common Rate** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| High-income settings (e.g., UK, US) | **3%** annually |
| LMIC guidelines / WHO | **3–5%** |
| Malaysian HTA (MaHTAS) | Often **3%** for costs and benefits |
- **Example**: Breast Cancer Case:

| **Metric** | **Without Discounting** | **With 3% Discounting** |
|------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Survival Gain | 0.8 QALYs | ~0.76 QALYs |
| Productivity Gains | RM 20,000 | ~RM 18,500 |
  - **Insight**: Discounting **reduces** future health and financial benefits.

### ⏳ Time Horizon
- **Definition**: *The length of time over which costs and outcomes are measured.*
- **Choosing a Horizon**:

| **Scenario** | **Recommended Horizon** |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Acute illness (e.g., influenza) | **1 year or less** |
| Chronic disease (e.g., cancer, diabetes) | **Lifetime** or **10–20 years** |
| Preventive intervention | Until **key outcomes** occur (e.g., cancer incidence avoided) |
- **Implications**: Breast Cancer Example:
  - **Short Horizon (1–2 years)**: Captures drug costs but misses survival gains.
  - **Lifetime Horizon**: Captures **reduced recurrence**, **survival**, and **return to work**.
  - **Risk**: Underestimating the horizon biases against **long-term interventions**.

---

## 📈 7. Incremental Analysis and ICER

### 📖 What is Incremental Analysis?
- **Definition**: *Compares the additional cost and benefit of one intervention versus another.*
- **Question**: *“How much more are we paying for each additional unit of outcome?”*

### 🧮 ICER Formula
- **Formula**:
  $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{New}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{Comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{New}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{Comparator}}} $$
  - **Numerator**: Incremental cost (RM).
  - **Denominator**: Incremental effectiveness (e.g., QALYs, life-years).

### 📊 Example: HER2+ Breast Cancer
- **Data**:

| **Option** | **Cost (RM)** | **QALYs Gained** |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Drug B (Standard) | 20,000 | 1.5 |
| Drug A (Targeted) | 60,000 | 2.0 |
- **Calculation**:
  $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{60,000 - 20,000}{2.0 - 1.5} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = \text{RM 80,000 per QALY} $$

### 🔍 Interpreting ICER
- **Threshold Comparison**:
  - **ICER < Threshold**: Intervention is **cost-effective**.
  - **ICER > Threshold**: May not be cost-effective, depending on context.
- **Threshold Types**:

| **Type** | **Value (Approx.)** |
|----------|---------------------|
| GDP per capita (1×) | ~RM 50,000/QALY |
| GDP per capita (3×) | ~RM 150,000/QALY |
| MOH/HTA Implied WTP | RM 90,000–120,000/QALY |
| Opportunity Cost-Based | ~RM 30,000–50,000/QALY |
- **Malaysia Context**:
  - **WHO-CHOICE**: <1× GDP (~RM 50,000) = **highly cost-effective**; 1–3× (~RM 50,000–150,000) = **cost-effective**.
  - **Critique**: GDP-based thresholds are **simplistic**, ignoring **budget constraints** and **opportunity costs**.
  - **Opportunity Cost-Based**: Reflects **health gains forgone** when diverting resources (more context-sensitive).

### 📈 Cost-Effectiveness Plane
- **Quadrants**:
  - **NE**: More costly, more effective (evaluate ICER).
  - **SE**: Less costly, more effective (**adopt**).
  - **SW**: Less costly, less effective (evaluate trade-offs).
  - **NW**: More costly, less effective (**reject**).
- **Implication**: Drug A’s **RM 80,000/QALY** in the NE quadrant requires threshold comparison.

### 📊 Mini Case: Colorectal Cancer Drug
- **Data**:

| **Option** | **Cost (RM)** | **QALYs Gained** |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| Standard Care | 20,000 | 1.5 |
| New Drug | 60,000 | 2.0 |
- **ICER**: RM 80,000/QALY.
- **Interpretation**:
  - **WTP Threshold (RM 100,000)**: **Cost-effective**.
  - **GDP Threshold (RM 50,000)**: **Borderline/not cost-effective**.
  - **Opportunity Cost (RM 30,000–40,000)**: **Not cost-effective**.

---

## 🔬 8. Sensitivity Analysis

### 📖 Why Sensitivity Analysis?
- **Purpose**: Tests **robustness** of results under **uncertainty** in parameters (e.g., costs, utilities, effects).
- **Rationale**: Real-world data are **imperfect**, relying on **assumptions** and **estimates**.
- **Question**: *“How much would our conclusion change if the numbers change?”*

### 📋 Types of Sensitivity Analysis
| **Type** | **Description** | **Example (Breast Cancer)** |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| **One-Way (Univariate)** | Vary one parameter at a time | Vary Drug A cost from RM 60,000 to RM 40,000 |
| **Multi-Way** | Vary multiple parameters simultaneously | Vary drug cost and utility score |
| **Scenario Analysis** | Test plausible real-world scenarios | Assume public vs. private provision costs |
| **Probabilistic (PSA)** | Assign distributions; use Monte Carlo simulation | 1,000 simulations of cost, utility values |
| **Threshold Analysis** | Determine value where result changes | At what price is Drug A no longer cost-effective? |

### 📈 Example: Breast Cancer Drug A vs. B
- **Base ICER**: RM 80,000/QALY.
- **One-Way Analysis**:
  - If Drug A price drops to **RM 45,000**: ICER = **RM 50,000/QALY** → **Cost-effective**.
  - If utility is **0.7** instead of **0.8**: ICER increases → **Less cost-effective**.
- **Threshold Analysis**: What’s the **maximum price** for Drug A to stay below **RM 100,000/QALY**?

### 📊 Tornado Diagram
- **Purpose**: Visualizes the **impact** of parameter changes on **incremental costs**.
- **Structure**:
  - Each **horizontal bar** shows the range of incremental costs when varying a parameter.
  - **Wider bars** indicate **greater influence**.
  - Parameters ordered from **most to least influential**.

### 🌟 Purpose of Sensitivity Analysis
- Tests **robustness** of results.
- Identifies **key drivers** of cost-effectiveness.
- Informs **confidence** in policy recommendations.
- Supports **transparent decision-making**.

## 🧮 9. Economic Modeling

### 📖 Why Use Economic Models?
- **Definition**: *Simplified representations of real-world clinical and economic processes.*
- **Purposes**:
  - **Extrapolate** outcomes beyond trial periods.
  - **Simulate** long-term costs and effects.
  - **Compare** interventions without direct head-to-head studies.
  - **Incorporate** uncertainty in decision-making.

### 📋 When Modeling is Needed
| **Scenario** | **Modeling Role** |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Short-term trial data, long-term outcomes | Project outcomes (e.g., survival) |
| Multiple care pathways or disease stages | Capture complexity (e.g., recurrence) |
| Rare diseases or low-event outcomes | Simulate events not captured in trials |
| Budget impact or scenario forecasting | Compare national-scale impact |

### 📈 Breast Cancer Case Example
- **Scenario**: Trial data for Drug A vs. Drug B has a **2-year follow-up**, but:
  - Disease may **recur** after 5 years.
  - **Survival** may extend beyond the trial.
  - **Costs** change post-treatment (e.g., monitoring, recurrence management).
- **Modeling Role**:
  - Estimates **lifetime QALYs**.
  - Projects **long-term costs**.
  - Assesses **cost-effectiveness** over patient lifespan.

### 📊 Basic Types of Economic Models
1. **Decision Tree**:
   - **Use**: Short-term, one-time decisions.
   - **Structure**: Branches represent **choices** and **outcomes**.
   - **Example**: Choosing between **Drug A** and **Drug B** for a **6-month adjuvant treatment**.
2. **Markov Model**:
   - **Use**: Chronic conditions or recurrent events.
   - **Structure**: Patients transition between **health states** (e.g., well, recurrence, dead) in **cycles** (e.g., yearly).
   - **Example**: Modeling breast cancer transitions: **Well → Local recurrence → Metastasis → Death**.

### 🔍 Key Components of a Markov Model
- **States**: Mutually exclusive (e.g., stable, recurrence, death).
- **Cycles**: Time steps (e.g., yearly).
- **Transition Probabilities**: Likelihood of moving between states.
- **Utilities and Costs**: Assigned to each state per cycle.

### 🌟 Advantages of Modeling
- Captures **long-term outcomes**.
- Incorporates **patient-level variability**.
- Supports **scenario analysis** and **policy planning**.

### ⚠️ Limitations
- Relies on **assumptions**.
- **Quality** depends on **input data**.
- **Complex models** may lack **transparency** if not clearly reported.

## 🚫 11. Common Mistakes in Economic Evaluation

### 📖 Overview
Robust economic evaluations require **methodological clarity** and **transparency**. Common errors can undermine **credibility** and **policy relevance**.

1. **Inappropriate or Unstated Perspective**:
   - **Why It Matters**: Perspective determines **cost** and **outcome** inclusion.
   - **Pitfall**: Using a **narrow perspective** (e.g., provider) when **societal impact** is relevant.
   - **Example**: Ignoring **OOP costs** in a cancer care study for low-income populations.

2. **Incorrect or Inconsistent Costing**:
   - **Why It Matters**: Accurate costing is the **foundation** of evaluation.
   - **Pitfall**: Using **outdated prices**, not adjusting for **inflation**, or mixing **price sources**.
   - **Example**: Using **private hospital rates** in a **public sector** evaluation.

3. **Inadequate Time Horizon**:
   - **Why It Matters**: Short horizons miss **long-term benefits** or **harms**.
   - **Pitfall**: Limiting analysis to **trial duration** for chronic conditions.
   - **Example**: **1-year horizon** for breast cancer, missing **10-year recurrence risk**.

4. **No Discounting of Future Costs/Benefits**:
   - **Why It Matters**: **Time preference** must be accounted for in long-term evaluations.
   - **Pitfall**: Ignoring discounting for horizons **exceeding 1 year**.
   - **Example**: Reporting **lifetime QALYs** without a **discount rate**.

5. **Missing or Weak Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - **Why It Matters**: **Uncertainty** requires robust testing.
