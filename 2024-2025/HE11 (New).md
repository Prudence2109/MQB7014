The lecture underscores that **transparent reporting** is essential for bridging the gap between research and policy, ensuring evaluations are **trustworthy**, **reproducible**, and **actionable** for stakeholders such as Malaysia’s **MaHTAS** and **Ministry of Health**.

### 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of the lecture, students are able to:

- **Understand** the purpose and structure of the **CHEERS 2022 checklist**, recognizing its role in ensuring **clarity** and **completeness** in reporting.
- **Identify** the six domains of high-quality economic evaluation reporting, including Title & Abstract, Methods, and Results.
- **Apply** CHEERS to appraise published studies, systematically evaluating reporting quality using a practical coding system (✅, 🟡, ❌).
- **Recognize** common reporting gaps (e.g., missing perspective, incomplete model details) and their implications for **policy relevance**.

### 🔍 Recap of Foundational Concepts

The lecture begins with a recap of **Economic Evaluation II**, outlining the systematic steps for conducting economic evaluations:

- **Define problem and comparators**, **choose perspective**, **identify, measure, and value costs and outcomes**, **apply discounting**, **calculate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, and **perform sensitivity analysis** and **modeling**.
- **Costing** includes **direct medical** (e.g., hospital stays), **direct non-medical** (e.g., travel), **indirect** (e.g., productivity losses), and **intangible** (e.g., pain) costs, with methods like **micro-costing** and **gross costing**.
- **Outcome measurement** involves **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)** (natural units, e.g., life-years), **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)** (e.g., **QALYs**, **DALYs**), and **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)** (monetized outcomes).
- **ICER** is calculated as:  
    $$\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Incremental Cost}}{\text{Incremental QALYs}}$$  
    and compared to thresholds (e.g., willingness-to-pay, GDP per capita).
- **Sensitivity analysis** (one-way, multi-way, probabilistic) tests robustness, while **economic modeling** (e.g., **decision trees**, **Markov models**) simulates long-term or complex outcomes.

**Key Takeaway**: **“Even the most precise analysis is only as useful as its clarity; economic evaluation must be methodologically sound and transparently reported.”**

### ❓ Importance of Critical Appraisal

Critical appraisal ensures that economic evaluations are **credible** and **policy-relevant**:

- **Problem**: Many studies appear robust with **advanced modeling** and **impressive ICERs** but lack credibility due to **poor reporting**.
- **Consequences of Poor Reporting**:
    - Cannot be **replicated** or **adapted** to contexts like Malaysia.
    - May **mislead policy decisions**, leading to **low trust** and **limited impact**.
- **Benefits of Well-Reported Studies**:
    - Support **justifiable reimbursement** (e.g., Peka B40), **efficient resource allocation** (e.g., cancer screening vs. ICU beds), and **HTA inclusion** (e.g., MaHTAS reviews).
- **Key Message**: **“A strong economic evaluation is not just about having the right model, it’s about reporting it clearly, so others can evaluate and trust your results.”**

### 📋 Understanding CHEERS 2022

The **CHEERS 2022 checklist**, developed by **ISPOR**, standardizes reporting to enhance **clarity** and **completeness**:

- **First Released**: 2013, updated in 2022.
- **Purpose**: Improve reporting, not judge study quality.
- **What It Is/Isn’t**:
    
|**CHEERS IS**|**CHEERS IS NOT**|
|---|---|
|A reporting checklist|A quality scoring tool|
|A guide for authors, reviewers, policy users|A tool for determining “good” vs. “bad” studies|
|Applicable to all economic evaluations|A substitute for peer review|
    
- **Why It Matters**: Addresses **incomplete or inconsistent reporting**, meeting stakeholder needs for **transparent methods**, **clear assumptions**, and **reproducible results**.
- **Example**: A study claiming “QALYs were estimated” without specifying the utility tool, preferences, or time horizon renders the ICER **uninterpretable**.
- **Policy Use**: Adopted by **HTA agencies** (e.g., NICE, MaHTAS), **journals**, and **researchers** to support **evidence transparency**.

**Key Takeaway**: **“If it’s not reported, it didn’t happen. CHEERS ensures every essential part of an economic evaluation is visible, understandable, and usable.”**

### 🧩 CHEERS 2022 Structure

The CHEERS 2022 checklist includes **28 items** across **6 domains**:

|**Domain**|**Purpose**|**Key Examples**|
|---|---|---|
|Title & Abstract|Identify as economic evaluation, summarize findings|Label study type, summarize ICER|
|Introduction|Explain research question and policy relevance|State objective, context|
|Methods|Describe how evaluation was conducted|Perspective, time horizon, modeling|
|Results|Present outcomes clearly|ICER, uncertainty, subgroups|
|Discussion|Reflect on limitations and implications|Generalizability, equity|
|Other Information|Promote transparency, reproducibility|Funding, conflicts of interest|

**Key Message**: **“Each domain tells part of the story. CHEERS doesn’t ask if your results are correct, only if readers can understand what you did, why, and how.”**

### 🔬 Focus on the Methods Section

The **methods section** is the **engine room** of an economic evaluation, covering **18 CHEERS items** (4–21) like perspective, costing, and modeling:

- **Why Critical**: Determines if findings are **understandable**, **reproducible**, and **policy-relevant**.
- **Example Gaps**:
    
|**CHEERS Item**|**Strong Reporting**|**Weak Reporting**|
|---|---|---|
|Perspective|“Health system perspective, per MaHTAS guidelines”|“Costs were included”|
|Discount Rate|“3% annually, per HTA norms”|“Discounting applied”|
|Sensitivity Analysis|“One-way and probabilistic analyses on costs, utilities”|“Sensitivity analysis done”|
    
- **Critical Question**: **“Could a policymaker or researcher reproduce this study based on the methods reported?”**

### 🛠️ Applying CHEERS in Practice

Applying CHEERS involves:

1. **Read section by section** (Title/Abstract → Discussion).
2. **Match sections to CHEERS items**.
3. **Evaluate** using a coding system:
    
|**Symbol**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|
|✅|Clearly reported|
|🟡|Unclear/incomplete|
|❌|Not reported|
    

This systematic approach ensures **transparent** and **objective** appraisal, critical for policy contexts like Malaysia.

### 📖 Case Study: Appraising a Published Study

The lecture appraises a study by Hofer et al. (2018) on lung cancer screening:

- **Title**: _Cost-utility analysis of a potential lung cancer screening program for a high-risk population in Germany: A modelling approach_
- **Objective**: Evaluate cost-effectiveness from a **public payer perspective** for heavy smokers (aged 55–75).
- **Methods**: Two **Markov models**, 60 cycles (3-month length), outcomes (costs, life years, QALYs), deterministic/probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
- **Results**: Incremental costs (€1,153/person), gains (0.06 life years, 0.04 QALYs), ICER (€19,302/LY, €30,291/QALY).
- **Appraisal**: 17 items ✅ (e.g., perspective, results), 4 🟡 (e.g., QALY valuation), 7 ❌ (e.g., subgroup heterogeneity, stakeholder engagement).

The appraisal highlights **strong reporting** in most areas but gaps in equity and stakeholder engagement, limiting full **policy applicability**.

### 🚨 Common Reporting Gaps

The **top five reporting gaps** include:

1. **Perspective Not Stated**: Misleads on cost/outcome scope (e.g., drug costs claimed as societal).
2. **No Justification for Time Horizon/Discount Rate**: Undermines long-term credibility (e.g., lifetime model without discounting).
3. **Omission of Sensitivity Analysis**: Limits uncertainty assessment (e.g., ICER without robustness testing).
4. **Incomplete Model Structure**: Hinders replication (e.g., Markov model without state details).
5. **Utility Sources Not Reported**: Affects QALY reliability (e.g., “literature weights” without citation).

These gaps reduce **trust**, **reproducibility**, and **policy uptake**, emphasizing the need for CHEERS compliance.

### 🌍 Policy Impact of Transparent Reporting

**Transparent reporting** enhances policy impact by:

- Supporting **HTAs**, **budget allocation**, **reimbursement** (e.g., Peka B40), and **guidelines**.
- **Local Relevance**: MaHTAS, HITAP, and NICE require CHEERS compliance for **MyHTA reports**, **pharmacoeconomic documents**, and **regional dialogues**.
- **Key Insight**: **“Health systems don’t make million-ringgit decisions on vague data. CHEERS bridges the gap between research and policy.”**

### 🗝️ Final Takeaways

- **CHEERS 2022** enhances **clarity**, **transparency**, and **policy usability**.
- **Appraisal** assesses **communication clarity**, complementing peer review.
- **Gaps** (e.g., missing perspective) reduce trust and applicability.
- **Transparent reporting** builds **trust** and **policy uptake**, critical for Malaysia’s healthcare system.

## 🔍 2. Recap of Economic Evaluation II

This section provides a comprehensive review of the foundational concepts covered in **Economic Evaluation II**, setting the stage for understanding the critical appraisal process in **Economic Evaluation III**. It outlines the systematic steps for conducting a full economic evaluation, details the types and methods of costing, explains outcome measurement approaches, introduces the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), and explores sensitivity analysis and economic modeling. These concepts are crucial for assessing the **transparency** and **clarity** of economic evaluations using the **CHEERS 2022 checklist**, as they form the methodological backbone that must be clearly reported for policy relevance. The recap emphasizes the importance of **methodological rigor** and **transparent reporting** to ensure evaluations are robust and usable in health policy decisions, such as those by Malaysia’s **MaHTAS** or other Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies.

### Steps in Conducting a Full Economic Evaluation

A **systematic approach** is essential for conducting robust and policy-relevant economic evaluations. These evaluations provide a structured framework to compare health interventions, ensuring that limited resources are allocated efficiently to maximize health outcomes. The key steps are:

- **Define the problem and comparators**: Clearly articulate the health issue and identify the interventions to be compared (e.g., a new drug vs. standard care). This step ensures the evaluation addresses a specific, relevant question.
- **Choose the perspective**: Select the viewpoint (e.g., **societal**, **health system**) that determines which costs and outcomes are included. For example, a societal perspective includes all costs, while a health system perspective focuses on direct medical costs.
- **Identify, measure, and value costs and outcomes**: Systematically account for all relevant costs (e.g., medical, non-medical) and outcomes (e.g., life-years, QALYs), quantifying them accurately to enable fair comparisons.
- **Apply discounting and set a relevant time horizon**: Adjust future costs and outcomes using a discount rate (e.g., 3%) to reflect their present value, and choose an appropriate time frame (e.g., lifetime for chronic diseases) to capture all relevant effects.
- **Calculate and interpret the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**: Compute the ICER to compare the additional costs and benefits of one intervention over another, interpreting it against thresholds like willingness-to-pay or GDP per capita.
- **Perform sensitivity analysis and, when needed, economic modeling**: Test the robustness of results by varying key parameters and use models (e.g., Markov models) to simulate long-term or complex outcomes.

These steps ensure that economic evaluations are **comprehensive**, **transparent**, and **aligned** with policy needs, providing decision-makers with reliable evidence to prioritize interventions.

### Costing in Economic Evaluations

Costing is a critical component of economic evaluations, as it quantifies the resources consumed by an intervention. Accurate costing ensures that evaluations reflect the true economic burden and enable fair comparisons between alternatives.

- **Types of Costs**:
    - **Direct Medical**: Costs directly related to healthcare delivery, such as **hospital stays** (e.g., ward costs, surgical procedures) and **medications** (e.g., drug prescriptions).
    - **Direct Non-Medical**: Costs incurred outside healthcare but related to accessing it, such as **travel** (e.g., transportation to clinics) and **caregiving** (e.g., time spent by family members).
    - **Indirect**: Economic impacts beyond direct expenses, such as **productivity losses** (e.g., lost wages due to illness or treatment).
    - **Intangible**: Non-financial costs that are difficult to quantify, such as **pain** or **suffering** experienced by patients, often considered qualitatively.
- **Costing Methods**:
    - **Micro-costing**: A detailed approach that identifies and measures each resource unit (e.g., cost per hospital bed-day, per consultation), providing high precision but requiring extensive data.
    - **Gross costing**: An aggregated approach that uses average or total costs (e.g., cost per patient episode), which is simpler but less detailed.
- **Perspective**: The chosen perspective determines which costs are included. For example:
    - A **societal perspective** includes all costs (medical, non-medical, indirect, and sometimes intangible).
    - A **health system perspective** focuses solely on direct medical costs, relevant for bodies like Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health (MOH)**.

Proper costing ensures that evaluations capture the full economic impact of interventions, aligning with the decision-maker’s perspective and context.

### Outcome Measurement

Measuring outcomes is essential for assessing the **health benefits** of interventions. Different types of economic evaluations use distinct outcome measures, each suited to specific decision-making needs.

- **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**: Measures outcomes in **natural units**, such as:
    - **Life-years gained**: Extending survival through treatments like heart surgery.
    - **Cases prevented**: Reducing disease incidence through interventions like vaccinations.
- **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)**: Uses **utility-based measures** that account for both quantity and quality of life, such as:
    - **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**: Combines life expectancy with quality of life, where 1 QALY represents one year in perfect health.
    - **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)**: Quantifies disease burden by measuring years lost due to disability or premature death.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**: **Monetizes outcomes**, converting health benefits into monetary values (e.g., the financial value of productivity gains from a health program).
- **Utility Values**: Essential for QALY calculations, these are often derived from standardized tools like **EQ-5D**, which measures health-related quality of life across dimensions like mobility and pain. These values reflect patient or population preferences, ensuring outcomes are meaningful.

Selecting the appropriate outcome measure ensures that evaluations capture the most relevant health impacts, facilitating comparisons across interventions.

### ICER and Thresholds

The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** is a key metric in economic evaluations, quantifying the additional cost per unit of additional health benefit when comparing two interventions.

- **Calculation**:  
    $$\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Incremental Cost}}{\text{Incremental QALYs}}$$
    
    - **Incremental Cost**: The difference in costs between the intervention and its comparator (e.g., new treatment vs. standard care).
    - **Incremental QALYs**: The difference in QALYs gained between the two options.
    - **Example**: If a new drug costs an additional RM50,000 and provides 0.5 extra QALYs compared to standard care, the ICER is:  
        $$\text{ICER} = \frac{50000}{0.5} = 100000 , \text{RM per QALY}$$
- **Interpretation**: The ICER is compared to **thresholds** to determine cost-effectiveness:
    
    - **Willingness-to-pay (WTP)**: The maximum amount a decision-maker is willing to pay for an additional unit of outcome (e.g., RM100,000 per QALY).
    - **GDP per capita**: Often used as a benchmark (e.g., 1–3 times GDP per capita in Malaysia for cost-effectiveness).
    - If the ICER is below the threshold, the intervention is considered cost-effective.
- **Influences**: The ICER is sensitive to:
    
    - **Time horizon**: A longer horizon (e.g., lifetime) may capture more benefits, lowering the ICER.
    - **Discounting**: Applying a discount rate (e.g., 3%) reduces the value of future costs and outcomes, affecting the ICER.

The ICER provides a standardized measure to guide resource allocation decisions, ensuring that interventions deliver value for money.

### Sensitivity Analysis

**Sensitivity analysis** tests the **robustness** of economic evaluation results by examining how changes in key parameters affect conclusions. It is critical for addressing uncertainty and ensuring that findings are reliable for policy decisions.

- **Types**:
    - **One-way**: Varies one parameter at a time (e.g., drug cost) to assess its impact on the ICER, identifying key drivers of results.
    - **Multi-way**: Varies multiple parameters simultaneously to explore combined effects, providing a broader view of uncertainty.
    - **Probabilistic**: Uses probability distributions for parameters (e.g., costs, utilities) to simulate a range of outcomes, often presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
- **Purpose**:
    - **Tests robustness**: Determines whether conclusions hold under different assumptions or data inputs.
    - **Identifies uncertainty**: Highlights parameters with the greatest impact on results, guiding further research or data collection.
    - **Example**: In a cancer treatment evaluation, sensitivity analysis might show that the ICER is highly sensitive to drug cost but robust to changes in utility values.

Sensitivity analysis ensures that evaluations are **transparent** about uncertainty, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions with confidence.

### Economic Modelling

**Economic modeling** is used when direct data are insufficient to capture long-term or complex outcomes, allowing analysts to simulate the impacts of interventions over time or across scenarios.

- **When Used**: Models are necessary for:
    - **Long-term outcomes**: When benefits (e.g., survival gains) extend beyond trial data (e.g., 10-year impacts of a cancer drug).
    - **Complex pathways**: When interventions involve multiple health states or transitions (e.g., chronic diseases with remission and relapse).
- **Types**:
    - **Decision Trees**: Suitable for **short-term outcomes**, modeling discrete choices and outcomes (e.g., surgical vs. non-surgical treatment for appendicitis).
    - **Markov Models**: Ideal for **chronic or recurrent conditions**, simulating transitions between health states over time (e.g., cancer progression with remission, relapse, and death states).
- **Example**: A Markov model for a diabetes intervention might simulate transitions between “healthy,” “complications,” and “death” states to estimate long-term costs and QALYs.

Economic modeling enhances the flexibility and applicability of evaluations, enabling decision-makers to assess interventions in scenarios where empirical data are limited.

### 🗝️ Key Takeaway

> **“Even the most precise analysis is only as useful as its clarity; economic evaluation must be methodologically sound and transparently reported.”**

This underscores the dual importance of **methodological rigor** and **transparent reporting**. A technically accurate evaluation is ineffective if its methods, assumptions, and results are not clearly communicated to stakeholders like policymakers or HTA agencies (e.g., MaHTAS). Transparent reporting ensures that evaluations are **reproducible**, **trustworthy**, and **usable** for informing health policy decisions, bridging the gap between research and real-world impact.

## ❓ 3. Why Critical Appraisal Matters

This section explores the critical importance of appraising economic evaluations to ensure their **credibility** and **utility** in health policy decision-making. While many economic evaluations appear robust, with sophisticated statistical methods and impressive results, their value hinges on **transparent reporting**. Without clear and complete reporting, even the most methodologically sound studies can lack credibility, limiting their impact on public health policy. Critical appraisal, guided by tools like the **CHEERS 2022 checklist**, enables stakeholders to assess whether evaluations are **reproducible**, **adaptable**, and **trustworthy**, particularly in contexts like Malaysia’s health system. By understanding the consequences of poor reporting and the benefits of well-reported studies, students will appreciate the role of critical appraisal in supporting **evidence-based**, **efficient**, and **equitable** resource allocation.

### The Problem with Economic Evaluations

Many economic evaluations appear robust but lack credibility due to poor reporting, undermining their ability to inform policy decisions effectively.

- **Look statistically rigorous** and use **advanced modeling**: Evaluations often employ complex statistical techniques or sophisticated models, such as Markov models, to simulate long-term outcomes, giving the impression of high quality.
- **Show impressive ICERs**: Results, such as low Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs), may suggest cost-effectiveness, making the intervention appear highly valuable.
- **Problem**: **If key details aren’t reported, we can’t assess their credibility.** Without clear documentation of methods, assumptions, or data sources, stakeholders cannot verify the validity of the results, rendering even the most precise analysis unreliable.

This issue highlights the need for critical appraisal to scrutinize the **transparency** and **completeness** of economic evaluations, ensuring they meet the standards required for policy relevance.

### Consequences of Poor Reporting

Poorly reported evaluations have significant drawbacks that limit their utility and impact in health policy and practice.

- **Cannot be replicated**: Without detailed reporting of methods (e.g., data sources, model structure), other researchers or policymakers cannot reproduce the study to confirm its findings.
- **Cannot be adapted to other contexts (e.g., Malaysia)**: Incomplete reporting prevents the application of results to different settings, such as adapting a study conducted in a high-income country to Malaysia’s resource-constrained health system.
- **May mislead policy decisions**: Vague or incomplete information can lead to incorrect conclusions, potentially resulting in inefficient or inequitable resource allocation.
- **Lack transparency**, leading to **low trust** and **limited impact**: Stakeholders, such as Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health** or **MaHTAS**, are less likely to trust or act on studies that lack clear reporting, reducing their influence on policy.

These consequences underscore the critical need for transparent reporting to ensure evaluations are **trustworthy** and **actionable** for decision-makers.

### Importance for Public Health and Policy

Well-reported studies, appraised using tools like CHEERS 2022, enable robust and informed decision-making in public health, supporting efficient and equitable resource allocation.

- **Justifiable reimbursement decisions**: Clear reporting allows policymakers to make evidence-based decisions about funding interventions, such as including treatments in Malaysia’s **Peka B40** program, which provides healthcare support for low-income groups.
- **Efficient resource allocation**: Transparent evaluations help prioritize interventions that maximize health outcomes within budget constraints, such as deciding whether to invest in **cancer screening** programs or additional **ICU beds**.
- **Inclusion in Health Technology Assessments (HTAs)**: Well-reported studies are more likely to meet the rigorous standards of HTA bodies like **MaHTAS** (Malaysia Health Technology Assessment Section), ensuring they inform national health policies and guidelines.

By providing **clarity** and **transparency**, well-reported evaluations strengthen the evidence base for health policy, enhancing trust and uptake among decision-makers.

### 🗝️ Key Message

> **“A strong economic evaluation is not just about having the right model, it’s about reporting it clearly, so others can evaluate and trust your results.”**

This emphasizes that the value of an economic evaluation lies not only in its methodological rigor but also in its ability to communicate findings clearly. Transparent reporting ensures that stakeholders, such as policymakers, researchers, and HTA agencies, can **evaluate**, **trust**, and **apply** the results to make informed decisions that optimize health outcomes within limited resources.

## 📋 4. Understanding CHEERS 2022

The **Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022** is a critical framework for ensuring **clarity** and **completeness** in the reporting of economic evaluations. Developed by the **International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR)**, CHEERS 2022 provides a standardized checklist to enhance the **transparency** and **usability** of economic evaluations, making them accessible to decision-makers, researchers, and health technology assessment (HTA) agencies. By understanding what CHEERS is, its purpose, and its role in policy and research, students will gain the tools to critically appraise studies, ensuring they meet the rigorous reporting standards needed to inform **evidence-based health policy** decisions in contexts like Malaysia’s healthcare system. This section sets the foundation for applying CHEERS to evaluate the quality of reporting in published studies, a key skill for public health professionals.

### What is CHEERS?

**CHEERS** (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) is a reporting framework developed by the **International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR)** to standardize and improve the reporting of economic evaluations in healthcare.

- **First Released**: 2013, establishing an initial set of guidelines to promote consistent reporting.
- **Updated**: 2022, incorporating advancements in health economics and feedback from stakeholders to enhance clarity and applicability.
- **Purpose**: Improve **reporting clarity and completeness**, not to judge study quality. CHEERS ensures that all essential components of an economic evaluation are clearly documented, enabling stakeholders to understand and trust the findings without assessing their methodological validity.

CHEERS serves as a vital tool for authors, reviewers, and policymakers, ensuring that economic evaluations are **transparent**, **reproducible**, and **policy-relevant**, particularly for HTA bodies like Malaysia’s **MaHTAS**.

### CHEERS: What It Is and Isn’t

To clarify its role, CHEERS is distinguished by what it is designed to achieve and what it does not do. The following table summarizes its scope:

|**CHEERS IS**|**CHEERS IS NOT**|
|---|---|
|A reporting checklist|A quality scoring tool|
|A guide for authors, reviewers, and policy users|A tool for determining “good” vs. “bad” studies|
|Applicable to all types of economic evaluation|A substitute for technical peer review|

- **A reporting checklist**: CHEERS provides a structured list of items to ensure all critical aspects of an economic evaluation (e.g., methods, results, assumptions) are reported clearly.
- **A guide for authors, reviewers, and policy users**: It assists researchers in preparing manuscripts, reviewers in evaluating submissions, and policymakers in interpreting findings for decision-making.
- **Applicable to all types of economic evaluation**: CHEERS is versatile, covering cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), cost-utility analysis (CUA), cost-benefit analysis (CBA), and cost-minimization analysis (CMA).
- **Not a quality scoring tool**: CHEERS focuses on reporting transparency, not on assessing the methodological rigor or validity of the study’s results.
- **Not a tool for determining “good” vs. “bad” studies**: It evaluates whether a study is clearly reported, not whether its conclusions are correct.
- **Not a substitute for technical peer review**: CHEERS complements, but does not replace, detailed methodological scrutiny by experts.

> **“CHEERS tells you if the study was clearly and completely reported—not whether the results are valid.”**

This distinction ensures that CHEERS is used appropriately as a **reporting standard**, guiding stakeholders to focus on transparency rather than substituting for in-depth technical evaluation.

### Why CHEERS Matters

The importance of CHEERS lies in addressing the pervasive issue of **incomplete or inconsistent reporting** in economic evaluations, which undermines their utility for decision-making.

- **Issue**: Reporting in economic evaluations is often **incomplete or inconsistent**, making it difficult for stakeholders to understand or trust the findings.
- **Needs of Stakeholders**:
    - **Decision-makers**, **HTA agencies** (e.g., **NICE** in the UK, **MaHTAS** in Malaysia), and **journals** require:
        - **Transparent methods**: Clear documentation of how the study was conducted, including data sources and analytical approaches.
        - **Clear assumptions**: Explicit reporting of assumptions (e.g., discount rates, utility values) to enable scrutiny.
        - **Reproducible results**: Sufficient detail to allow other researchers or policymakers to replicate or adapt the study.
- **Example**: A study claims “QALYs were estimated” but omits critical details:
    - Which **utility tool** was used (e.g., EQ-5D, SF-6D)?
    - **Whose preferences** were considered (e.g., patient or population-based)?
    - **Time horizon** or **discounting details** (e.g., 3% discount rate, lifetime horizon)?
    - **Impact**: Without these details, even a correct Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is **uninterpretable**, as stakeholders cannot assess its validity or relevance.

Incomplete reporting reduces the credibility of evaluations, limiting their ability to inform **evidence-based decisions** in health policy and practice.

## 🔬 6. Focus on the Methods Section

This section delves into the critical importance of the **methods section** in economic evaluations, emphasizing its role as the **core component** that determines the **transparency**, **reproducibility**, and **policy relevance** of a study. The **Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 checklist** dedicates **18 items** (items 4–21) to the methods section, covering essential aspects such as perspective, costing, modeling, and stakeholder engagement. By providing detailed and clear reporting of these elements, the methods section ensures that findings are **understandable** to stakeholders like policymakers and **reproducible** by researchers, enabling informed decision-making in contexts such as Malaysia’s health system. This section also presents examples of strong and weak reporting practices and poses a critical question to guide appraisal, equipping students with the skills to evaluate the quality of reporting in economic evaluations using CHEERS 2022.

### Why Focus on Methods?

The **methods section** is the **engine room** of an economic evaluation, serving as the foundation for its credibility and utility in health policy.

- The **methods section** is the **engine room** of an economic evaluation: It contains the technical details that underpin the study’s findings, making it the most critical component for assessing the validity and applicability of results.
- It determines whether findings are **understandable**, **reproducible**, and **policy-relevant**: Clear reporting ensures that policymakers (e.g., Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health** or **MaHTAS**) can comprehend the study’s approach, researchers can replicate it, and decision-makers can apply it to real-world contexts.
- CHEERS includes **18 items** under Methods (items 4–21), covering aspects like perspective, costing, modeling, and stakeholder engagement: These items address critical elements such as the study’s perspective, time horizon, data sources, and analytical methods, ensuring comprehensive documentation.

A well-reported methods section is essential for bridging the gap between research and policy, enabling stakeholders to trust and act on the findings of economic evaluations.

### Example CHEERS Items from the Methods Section

To illustrate the importance of transparent reporting, the table below compares **strong** and **weak/incomplete** reporting examples for key CHEERS items in the methods section. These examples highlight how detailed reporting enhances clarity and reproducibility, while vague reporting undermines the study’s utility.

|**CHEERS Item**|**Strong Reporting Example**|**Weak/Incomplete Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Perspective (Item 8)**|“A health system perspective was adopted, including only direct medical costs as per MaHTAS guidelines.”|“Costs were included.”|
|**Time Horizon (Item 9)**|“Lifetime horizon was used to reflect long-term recurrence and survival.”|“Analysis was done for a few years.”|
|**Discount Rate (Item 10)**|“Both costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually, consistent with HTA norms.”|“Discounting was applied.”|
|**Health Outcomes (Item 11)**|“QALYs were estimated using EQ-5D-5L with Malaysian value set.”|“QALYs were used.”|
|**Costing Approach (Item 14)**|“Resource use was obtained from clinical records and unit costs were sourced from MOH tariffs.”|“Costs were estimated.”|
|**Modelling Approach (Item 16)**|“A Markov model with 1-year cycles simulated transitions between remission, relapse, and death.”|“A model was used to project results.”|
|**Sensitivity Analysis (Item 20)**|“One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted on drug cost, utilities, and transition probabilities.”|“Sensitivity analysis was done.”|

- **Perspective (Item 8)**: Strong reporting specifies the perspective (e.g., health system) and aligns it with guidelines (e.g., MaHTAS), while weak reporting vaguely mentions costs without context.
- **Time Horizon (Item 9)**: Strong reporting justifies a lifetime horizon for capturing long-term outcomes, whereas weak reporting provides an ambiguous timeframe.
- **Discount Rate (Item 10)**: Strong reporting details the discount rate (e.g., 3%) and its alignment with HTA standards, while weak reporting fails to specify the rate or rationale.
- **Health Outcomes (Item 11)**: Strong reporting identifies the tool (e.g., EQ-5D-5L) and value set (e.g., Malaysian), ensuring clarity, while weak reporting is vague about QALY estimation.
- **Costing Approach (Item 14)**: Strong reporting details data sources (e.g., clinical records, MOH tariffs), enabling verification, while weak reporting lacks specificity.
- **Modelling Approach (Item 16)**: Strong reporting describes the model structure (e.g., Markov model with 1-year cycles) and states, while weak reporting omits details.
- **Sensitivity Analysis (Item 20)**: Strong reporting specifies the types (e.g., one-way, probabilistic) and parameters tested, while weak reporting is non-specific.

These examples demonstrate that **strong reporting** provides the detail needed for **transparency** and **reproducibility**, while **weak reporting** leaves stakeholders unable to assess or trust the findings.

### Critical Question

> **Could a policymaker or another researcher reproduce this study based on what’s reported in the methods section?**

This underscores the importance of the methods section in enabling **reproducibility**. A well-reported methods section should provide sufficient detail for policymakers to understand the study’s approach and for researchers to replicate it in other contexts. If key details—such as data sources, model structure, or analytical methods—are missing or unclear, the study’s findings cannot be verified or applied, reducing its **policy impact**. This question serves as a guiding principle for appraising economic evaluations using the CHEERS 2022 checklist, ensuring that the methods section meets the standards of **clarity** and **completeness**.

## 🛠️ 7. Applying CHEERS in Practice

This section provides a practical guide to applying the **Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 checklist** to critically appraise economic evaluation studies. By outlining a systematic approach to reviewing studies section by section and introducing a **practical coding system**, this section equips students with the tools to evaluate the **transparency** and **completeness** of reporting in economic evaluations. These skills are essential for assessing whether studies meet the rigorous standards required by stakeholders, such as Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies, ensuring that findings are **understandable**, **reproducible**, and **policy-relevant**. Mastering this process enables public health professionals to identify high-quality studies and recognize reporting gaps, contributing to **evidence-based decision-making** in resource-constrained health systems.

### How to Use the CHEERS Checklist

The CHEERS 2022 checklist, with its **6 domains** and **28 items**, provides a structured framework for appraising economic evaluations. The following steps outline a systematic approach to applying the checklist, ensuring that each section of a study is evaluated for clarity and completeness:

1. **Read the Article Section by Section**:
    - **Title/Abstract → Introduction → Methods → Results → Discussion**: Review the study systematically, starting with the title and abstract to understand its scope, moving through the introduction to grasp its context, analyzing the methods for technical rigor, evaluating the results for clarity, and assessing the discussion for implications and limitations.
2. **Match Sections to CHEERS Items**:
    - **Use the 6 domains and 28 checklist items as a guide**: Align each section of the study with the corresponding CHEERS domain (e.g., Title & Abstract, Methods) and specific items (e.g., item 8 for perspective, item 10 for discount rate) to ensure all reporting requirements are addressed.
3. **Evaluate Each Item**:
    - ✅ **Clearly and fully reported**?: Determine if the item is reported with sufficient detail to be understandable and reproducible (e.g., specifying a discount rate of 3% with justification).
    - 🟡 **Mentioned but unclear/incomplete**?: Assess whether the item is mentioned but lacks detail or clarity (e.g., stating “QALYs were used” without specifying the utility tool).
    - ❌ **Missing altogether**?: Identify if the item is entirely absent, undermining the study’s transparency (e.g., no mention of the study’s perspective).

This systematic approach ensures that evaluations are thoroughly assessed for **transparency**, enabling stakeholders to determine whether the study can be trusted and applied in policy contexts like Malaysia’s healthcare system.

### Practical Coding System

To facilitate a consistent and objective appraisal, the CHEERS checklist is supported by a **practical coding system** that categorizes the quality of reporting for each item. The following table outlines the symbols and their meanings:

|**Symbol**|**Meaning**|
|---|---|
|✅|Clearly and transparently reported|
|🟡|Mentioned, but unclear or incomplete|
|❌|Not reported|

- **✅ Clearly and transparently reported**: The item is fully documented with sufficient detail to allow understanding and replication (e.g., “A Markov model with 1-year cycles simulated transitions between remission, relapse, and death”).
- **🟡 Mentioned, but unclear or incomplete**: The item is referenced but lacks critical details, making it difficult to assess or replicate (e.g., “A model was used to project results” without specifying the model type).
- **❌ Not reported**: The item is entirely absent, significantly undermining the study’s transparency and utility (e.g., no mention of the discount rate).

**Use this system to systematically critique economic evaluation studies**: By applying these symbols to each of the 28 CHEERS items, students can methodically evaluate a study’s reporting quality, identifying strengths and gaps. This approach is particularly valuable for assessing studies submitted to **HTA agencies** or journals, ensuring they meet the standards required for **policy-relevant** decision-making.

## 🚨 9. Top 5 Common Reporting Gaps

This section identifies the **top five common reporting gaps** in economic evaluations, highlighting frequent deficiencies that undermine the **transparency**, **reproducibility**, and **policy relevance** of studies. These gaps, often observed in published economic evaluations, can prevent stakeholders such as policymakers, researchers, and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agencies like Malaysia’s **MaHTAS** from fully understanding or trusting study findings. By detailing each gap, its implications, and illustrative examples, this section equips students with the ability to recognize and address these issues when appraising studies using the **CHEERS 2022 checklist**. Understanding these gaps is crucial for ensuring that economic evaluations are **clear**, **complete**, and **actionable** in informing **evidence-based health policy** decisions, particularly in resource-constrained settings like Malaysia’s healthcare system.

### Common Reporting Deficiencies in Economic Evaluations

The following are the most frequent reporting deficiencies in economic evaluations, with implications for transparency and policy relevance. Each gap is presented with its **issue**, **why it matters**, and an **example** to illustrate its impact:

1. **Perspective Not Stated**:
    
    - **Issue**: Studies fail to clarify whether the perspective is societal, payer, or provider, leaving ambiguity about the scope of costs and outcomes considered.
    - **Why It Matters**: Perspective determines which costs and outcomes should be included, directly affecting the study’s relevance and applicability. For instance, a societal perspective includes indirect costs like productivity losses, while a payer perspective focuses on reimbursed costs.
    - **Example**: A study includes only drug costs but claims societal relevance, misleading readers about the comprehensiveness of the analysis and potentially skewing policy decisions.
2. **No Justification for Time Horizon or Discount Rate**:
    
    - **Issue**: Time horizons may be chosen arbitrarily, and discounting may be unexplained or omitted entirely, reducing the credibility of long-term projections.
    - **Why It Matters**: Short timeframes can misrepresent chronic disease costs and benefits, while discounting ensures appropriate weighting of future outcomes. Without justification, stakeholders cannot assess the appropriateness of these choices.
    - **Example**: Lifetime outcomes are modeled without reported discounting, making it impossible to evaluate how future costs and benefits were valued, potentially inflating results.
3. **Omission of Sensitivity Analysis**:
    
    - **Issue**: Sensitivity analyses are often missing or inadequately reported, leaving uncertainty in results unaddressed.
    - **Why It Matters**: Policymakers need to understand how uncertainty affects conclusions to make informed decisions. Sensitivity analysis tests the robustness of results, ensuring reliability across varying assumptions.
    - **Example**: A base-case Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is reported without robustness testing, leaving policymakers unsure if the results hold under different conditions.
4. **Incomplete Model Structure Explanation**:
    
    - **Issue**: Models (e.g., decision trees, Markov models) lack details on states, transitions, or cycle length, obscuring the analytical framework.
    - **Why It Matters**: Transparency in model structure allows replication and critical appraisal, ensuring that the study’s methodology is verifiable and trustworthy.
    - **Example**: A Markov model is used without a diagram or state logic provided, preventing researchers from understanding or replicating the model’s design.
5. **Utility Sources Not Reported**:
    
    - **Issue**: Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) calculations lack details on instruments (e.g., EQ-5D, SF-6D) or population-specific value sets, reducing transparency in outcome measurement.
    - **Why It Matters**: Utility weights vary by setting and significantly impact QALY estimates, affecting the study’s conclusions and comparability across contexts.
    - **Example**: A study states “utility weights from the literature” without citation, leaving readers unable to verify the source or appropriateness of the weights.

### Implications for Transparency and Policy Relevance

These reporting gaps have significant implications for the **transparency** and **policy relevance** of economic evaluations:

- **Reduced Trust**: Incomplete or unclear reporting undermines confidence among stakeholders, such as Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health** or **MaHTAS**, making it difficult to rely on the study for decision-making.
