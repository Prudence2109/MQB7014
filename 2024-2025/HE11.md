## 🩺 2. Recap of Economic Evaluation II

### 📖 Key Concepts from EE II

- **Costing**:
  - **Types**: 
    - **Direct Medical**: Costs incurred by the health system/provider (e.g., chemotherapy drugs, oncologist fees, infusion room, lab tests) 🩺.
    - **Direct Non-Medical**: Non-medical expenses due to seeking care (e.g., patient travel, parking, accommodation) 🚗.
    - **Indirect**: Productivity losses due to illness or treatment (e.g., sick leave, early retirement) 💼.
    - **Intangible**: Non-financial costs hard to quantify (e.g., anxiety, pain, hair loss stigma) 😟.
  - **Methods**: 
    - **Micro-Costing**: Detailed itemization of resources, used for high precision (e.g., clinical trials).
    - **Gross-Costing**: Average cost per service unit, used for budget planning or secondary data.
  - **Perspective**: Determines which **costs** are included (e.g., societal includes all costs, health system focuses on medical costs).
- **Outcome Measurement**:
  - **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**: Uses **natural units** (e.g., life-years gained, cases prevented).
  - **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)**: Uses **utility-based measures** like **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** or **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)**.
  - **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**: Outcomes monetized (e.g., RM value of productivity).
  - **Utility Values**: Essential for QALY calculations, often derived from tools like **EQ-5D** ⚖️.

### 📜 Key Takeaway

- *“Even the most precise analysis is only as useful as its clarity; economic evaluation must be transparent to be usable.”*  
  - Transparent reporting ensures **policymakers**, **HTA agencies**, and **researchers** can trust and apply evaluation results.

## 📋 3. Why Critical Appraisal Matters

### 📖 The Problem

Many **economic evaluations** appear robust, with **statistically rigorous models** and **impressive Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs)**, but **incomplete reporting** undermines their **credibility**. Without clear reporting, decision-makers cannot assess the **validity** or **relevance** of findings.

- **Issues**:
  - Evaluations may look **rigorous** and use **advanced modeling** but fail to report **key details**.
  - **Example**: A study stating “QALYs were estimated” without specifying:
    - **Utility tool** (e.g., EQ-5D, SF-6D).
    - **Preferences** (e.g., whose values were used).
    - **Time horizon** or **discounting** method.
  - Such omissions make even a **correct ICER** uninterpretable.

### 🌟 Why It Matters for Public Health and Policy

- **Poorly reported evaluations** hinder **decision-making** in:
  - **Health Technology Assessments (HTA)**.
  - **Budget impact analysis** and **resource allocation**.
  - **Reimbursement decisions** and **coverage recommendations**.
  - **National clinical guidelines** and **service prioritization**.
- **Key Message**: *“A strong economic evaluation is not just about having the right model, it’s about reporting it clearly, so others can evaluate and trust your results.”*

## 🚫 8. Common Reporting Gaps in Economic Evaluations

### 📖 Overview

Incomplete or inconsistent reporting undermines the **credibility** and **usability** of economic evaluations. The **top 5 reporting gaps** identified in the lecture are critical to address for **policy-relevant** studies.

1. **Perspective Not Stated**:
   - **Issue**: Many studies fail to clarify whether the analysis uses a **societal**, **payer**, or **provider** perspective.
   - **Why It Matters**: Perspective determines **which costs** and **outcomes** should be included.
   - **Example**: A study includes only **drug costs** but claims **societal relevance**, misleading stakeholders.

2. **No Justification for Time Horizon or Discount Rate**:
   - **Issue**: Time horizons are sometimes chosen **randomly**, and **discounting** may be applied without explanation or omitted.
   - **Why It Matters**: 
     - Short timeframes can **misrepresent** chronic disease costs/benefits.
     - Discounting ensures **future costs/outcomes** are weighted appropriately.
   - **Example**: Modeling **lifetime outcomes** without reporting **discounting**.

3. **Omission of Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - **Issue**: Studies may lack **sensitivity analysis** or test only **trivial variables**.
   - **Why It Matters**: Sensitivity analysis tests **robustness** under uncertainty, critical for **policy confidence**.
   - **Example**: Not testing variations in **utility scores** for high-impact side effects.

4. **Incomplete Model Structure Explanation**:
   - **Issue**: Models (e.g., Markov) are used without detailing **structure**, **assumptions**, or **parameters** (e.g., transition probabilities).
   - **Why It Matters**: Without clarity, models are **opaque** and **non-reproducible**.
   - **Example**: Stating “a model was used” without specifying **health states** or **cycle length**.

5. **Utility Sources Not Reported**:
   - **Issue**: Studies state **QALYs** were calculated but omit details on:
     - **Instruments** used (e.g., EQ-5D, SF-6D).
     - **Population** or **country-specific value sets**.
   - **Why It Matters**: **Utility weights** vary by setting and impact **QALY estimates**.
   - **Example**: Stating “utility weights from the literature” without citation.
