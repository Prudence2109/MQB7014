## 🩺 2. Recap of Economic Evaluation II

### 📖 Key Concepts from EE II
- **Costing**:
  - **Types**:
    - **Direct Medical**: Costs incurred by the health system/provider (e.g., chemotherapy drugs, oncologist fees, infusion room, lab tests) 🩺.
    - **Direct Non-Medical**: Non-medical expenses due to seeking care (e.g., patient travel, parking, accommodation near hospital) 🚗.
    - **Indirect**: Productivity losses due to illness or treatment (e.g., sick leave during chemo cycles, early retirement due to fatigue) 💼.
    - **Intangible**: Non-financial costs hard to quantify (e.g., anxiety, pain, hair loss stigma, emotional distress) 😟.
  - **Costing Methods**:
    - **Micro-Costing**: Itemizes and values each resource in detail, used for high precision (e.g., alongside clinical trials).
    - **Gross-Costing**: Uses average cost per service unit, suitable for budget planning or secondary data.
  - **Perspective**: Determines which **costs** are included (e.g., societal includes all costs, health system focuses on direct medical costs).
- **Outcome Measurement**:
  - **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**: Uses **natural units** (e.g., life-years gained, cases prevented).
  - **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)**: Uses **utility-based measures** like **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** or **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)** ⚖️.
  - **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**: Outcomes monetized (e.g., RM value of productivity).
  - **Utility Values**: Essential for QALY calculations, often derived from tools like **EQ-5D**.

### 📜 Key Takeaway
- *“Even the most precise analysis is only as useful as its clarity, economic evaluation must be transparent to be usable.”* (Slide 6, repeated due to OCR error).
  - **Transparency** ensures **policymakers**, **HTA agencies**, and **researchers** can trust and apply evaluation results.

### 📢 Note on Slide 6
- **Issue**: Slide 6 repeatedly states *“KEY TAKEAWAY: Even the most precise analysis is only as useful as its clarity, economic evaluation must”*, truncated multiple times (14,271 characters). This is likely an OCR error, as the repetition is non-informative. The takeaway is interpreted as emphasizing **transparency** in reporting, consistent with the lecture’s focus.

## 📋 3. Why Critical Appraisal Matters

### 📖 The Problem
Many **economic evaluations** appear robust, using **statistically rigorous models** and **impressive Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs)**, but **incomplete reporting** undermines their **credibility**. Without clear reporting, decision-makers cannot assess the **validity** or **relevance** of findings.

- **Issues**:
  - Evaluations may look **rigorous** and use **advanced modeling** but fail to report **key details** (Slide 7).
  - **Example**: A study stating “QALYs were estimated” without specifying:
    - **Which utility tool?** (e.g., EQ-5D, SF-6D).
    - **Whose preferences?** (e.g., population or country-specific value set).
    - **Time horizon or discounting?**
  - Such omissions make even a **correct ICER** uninterpretable (Slide 12).
- **Poorly Reported Evaluations** (Slide 8, incomplete): Lack of clarity hinders their use in **decision-making**.

### 🌟 Why It Matters for Public Health and Policy
- **Impact**: **Poorly reported evaluations** cannot inform:
  - **Health Technology Assessments (HTA)**.
  - **Budget impact analysis** and **resource allocation**.
  - **Reimbursement decisions** and **coverage recommendations**.
  - **National clinical guidelines** and **service prioritization** (Slide 36).
- **Key Message**: *“A strong economic evaluation is not just about having the right model, it’s about reporting it clearly, so others can evaluate and trust your results.”* (Slide 9).

### 📜 CHEERS in Policy and Research
- **Widely Used By** (Slide 13):
  - **HTA agencies** (e.g., NICE in the UK, MaHTAS in Malaysia).
  - **Peer-reviewed journals** for manuscript preparation.
  - **Researchers** to align with **evidence transparency** in health system decision-making.
- **Key Takeaway**: *“If it’s not reported, it didn’t happen. CHEERS ensures every essential part of an economic evaluation is visible, understandable, and usable.”* (Slide 13).

## 🚫 8. Common Reporting Gaps in Economic Evaluations

### 📖 Overview
Incomplete or inconsistent reporting undermines the **credibility** and **usability** of economic evaluations. The lecture identifies the **top 5 reporting gaps**, critical for ensuring **policy-relevant** studies (Slides 31–35).

1. **Perspective Not Stated** (Slide 31):
   - **Issue**: Many studies fail to clarify whether the analysis uses a **societal**, **payer**, or **provider** perspective.
   - **Why It Matters**: Perspective determines **which costs** and **outcomes** should be included, affecting **interpretation**.
   - **Example**: A study includes only **drug costs** but claims **societal relevance**, misleading stakeholders about broader impacts.

2. **No Justification for Time Horizon or Discount Rate** (Slide 32):
   - **Issue**: 
     - **Time horizons** are sometimes chosen **randomly**.
     - **Discounting** may be applied without explanation or omitted entirely.
   - **Why It Matters**:
     - Short timeframes can **misrepresent** costs/benefits of chronic diseases.
     - Discounting ensures **future costs/outcomes** are weighted appropriately to reflect time preference.
   - **Example**: Modeling **lifetime outcomes** for breast cancer without reporting **discounting**, leading to inflated QALY estimates.

3. **Omission of Sensitivity Analysis** (Slide 33):
   - **Issue**: Studies may lack **sensitivity analysis** or test only **trivial variables**, despite the term being misspelled as “Sensitytyy Anayy” (OCR error).
   - **Why It Matters**: Sensitivity analysis tests **robustness** under uncertainty, critical for **policy confidence** in results.
   - **Example**: Not testing variations in **utility scores** for high-impact side effects, reducing trust in cost-effectiveness conclusions.

4. **Incomplete Model Structure Explanation** (Slide 34):
   - **Issue**: Models (e.g., Markov) are used without detailing **structure**, **assumptions**, or **parameters** (e.g., transition probabilities). Slide 34’s repetitive “Incomplete Model Structure Explanation” (15,324 characters) is an OCR error but indicates this gap.
   - **Why It Matters**: Without clarity, models are **opaque** and **non-reproducible**, undermining their use in policy.
   - **Example**: Stating “a model was used” without specifying **health states**, **cycle length**, or **transition probabilities**.

5. **Utility Sources Not Reported** (Slide 35):
   - **Issue**: Studies state **QALYs** were calculated but omit details on:
     - **Instruments** used (e.g., EQ-5D, SF-6D).
     - **Population** or **country-specific value sets**.
   - **Why It Matters**: **Utility weights** vary by setting and significantly impact **QALY estimates**, affecting cost-effectiveness results.
   - **Example**: Stating “utility weights from the literature” without citation, preventing verification.

  - **Health Technology Assessments (HTA)**.
  - **Budget impact analysis** and **resource allocation**.
  - **Reimbursement decisions** and **coverage recommendations**.
  - **National clinical guidelines** and **service prioritization**.
- **Impact of Poor Reporting**: Unclear studies cannot be used by **policymakers**, regardless of result validity, reducing their **policy impact**.

### 📋 Key Takeaways (Slide 38)
- **CHEERS 2022** enhances **clarity**, **transparency**, and **policy usability** of economic evaluations.
- **Appraising with CHEERS**:
  - Helps assess **what was done** and **how clearly it was communicated**.
  - Is distinct from **technical peer review** but equally essential for ensuring usability.
- **Common Gaps**:
  - Missing **perspective**, **discounting**, and **sensitivity analyses**.
  - Poor explanation of **models** and **QALY derivation**.
- **Transparent Reporting**: Builds **trust** and increases **policy uptake**, ensuring evaluations influence **real-world decisions**.
