## Today‚Äôs Focus: From Numbers to Decisions üåç

Lecture IV shifts from methodological details to real-world application. We explore:

- **Interpreting ICERs** against WTP thresholds and budget constraints.
- **Understanding DRG/case-mix costing** for large-scale health financing.
- **Making policy decisions** that balance cost-effectiveness, feasibility, and equity.

Today‚Äôs lecture is not about learning new techniques but about using EE results in the **complex, messy world of policy**. We ask: _How do we translate numbers into actionable decisions?_

## Understanding the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) üìä

The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** is a core metric in economic evaluations, comparing two interventions to assess value for money.

### ICER Formula

The ICER is calculated as:  
$$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{new}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{new}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{comparator}}} $$

- **Numerator**: Difference in costs between the new intervention and the comparator (e.g., usual care).
- **Denominator**: Difference in health outcomes, typically measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) or Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).
- **Interpretation**: The ICER represents the **additional cost per additional unit of health outcome** (e.g., RM per QALY gained).

**Example**: If a new drug costs RM 100,000 more than standard care and yields 2 additional QALYs, the ICER is:  
$$ \text{ICER} = \frac{100,000}{2} = 50,000 , \text{RM/QALY} $$

### Why a Good ICER Isn‚Äôt Enough üö¶

A low ICER suggests cost-effectiveness, but it‚Äôs **not a guaranteed green light** for funding. Policy decisions require broader considerations:

|**Factor**|**Explanation**|**Emoji**|
|---|---|---|
|**Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)**|Is the ICER below the country‚Äôs cost-effectiveness threshold?|üéØ|
|**Budget Impact**|Can the intervention be afforded at scale, even if cost-effective per patient?|üí∞|
|**Equity & Ethics**|Who benefits? Are vulnerable or marginalized groups reached?|‚öñÔ∏è|
|**Clinical Context**|Is the health benefit significant enough to matter in practice?|üìà|
|**System Readiness**|Can the health system feasibly implement the intervention?|üè•|

**Key Takeaway**: A **low ICER is a good start but not the finish line**. Policy decisions require more than mathematics‚Äîthey demand context, judgment, and values.

### Decision Flow for ICER Evaluation

The following flowchart summarizes the decision-making process:

1. **Is ICER < WTP Threshold?**
    - **Yes**: Proceed to next step.
    - **No**: Reject (continue usual care).
2. **Consider Budget Impact**: Can the intervention be funded at scale?
3. **Consider Feasibility**: Is implementation practical?
4. **Final Funding Decision**: Approve or reject based on all factors.

## Cost-Effectiveness Thresholds üìè

A **cost-effectiveness threshold** is the **maximum amount** a health system or society is willing to pay for one unit of health gain, such as:

- **One QALY gained**.
- **One DALY averted**.

The ICER is compared to this threshold to determine if an intervention is **cost-effective**.

### Interpretation Example

|**Intervention**|**ICER (RM/QALY)**|**WTP Threshold (RM/QALY)**|**Decision**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Intervention A|60,000|120,000|‚úÖ Cost-effective|
|Intervention B|150,000|120,000|‚ùå Not cost-effective|

- **Intervention A**: ICER is below the threshold, indicating cost-effectiveness.
- **Intervention B**: ICER exceeds the threshold, suggesting it‚Äôs not cost-effective.

### Sources of Thresholds

Thresholds vary by country and context. Common methods to establish them include:

|**Method**|**Explanation**|
|---|---|
|**1‚Äì3√ó GDP per capita**|Early WHO-CHOICE guidance (e.g., Malaysia: RM 48,000‚Äì144,000).|
|**WTP Studies (CV/DCE)**|Surveys measuring how much individuals/society would pay for a QALY.|
|**Historical Benchmarks**|Based on past funding decisions (revealed preferences).|
|**Deliberative Process**|HTA panels or policy consensus (e.g., Thailand‚Äôs HTA committee).|

**Cautions ‚ö†Ô∏è**:

- **Thresholds are not universal or static**. They depend on economic conditions and priorities.
- A **favorable ICER does not guarantee approval**. Budget impact, feasibility, and ethical implications must be considered.
- Thresholds provide a **reference point**, but real decisions require **context and judgment**.

## Exercise: Which Intervention Is Worth Funding? üß†

You are advising the **Ministry of Health (MOH)** on funding decisions based on three recent economic evaluations. The WTP threshold is **RM 120,000 per QALY**. Use the data below to recommend an intervention and justify your choice.

|**Intervention**|**ICER (RM/QALY)**|**Total Budget Impact (Annual)**|**Target Population Size**|**Feasibility Notes**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**A: HPV Self-Sampling**|85,000|RM 50 million|500,000 women|Mobile deployment required|
|**B: Stroke Rehabilitation**|130,000|RM 15 million|80,000 patients|Implemented in select rehab centers|
|**C: Type 2 DM Screening**|95,000|RM 200 million|1.5 million adults|High staff training and IT costs upfront|

### Discussion Questions

1. **Which ICERs are below the WTP threshold?**
2. **Which intervention has the most favorable ICER?**
3. **Does budget impact change your recommendation?**
4. **What if equity is a policy priority?**
5. **What if the program must be implemented within 12 months?**

### Key Insights

- **No right or wrong answer**‚Äîthe **rationale is critical**.
- **Contextual trade-offs** include affordability, scale, feasibility, urgency, and equity.
- Even if interventions are cost-effective, **policy decisions require value judgments** based on:
    - **Affordability**: Can the MOH budget sustain the cost?
    - **Readiness**: Is the health system equipped to deliver?
    - **Equity**: Does it address underserved populations?

## Budget Impact vs. Cost-Effectiveness üí∏

A low ICER may still be **unaffordable** at scale. Budget impact analysis (BIA) complements cost-effectiveness by assessing **total system costs**.

### Example Comparison

|**ICER (RM/QALY)**|**Total Population Impacted**|**Total Cost to Health System**|
|---|---|---|
|85,000|500,000 people|RM 42.5 million|
|95,000|1.5 million people|RM 142.5 million|

- **Both interventions are cost-effective** (ICERs below RM 120,000/QALY).
- **But the second costs 3√ó more** overall, straining the budget.

### Why Budget Impact Matters

|**Aspect**|**Cost-Effectiveness**|**Budget Impact**|
|---|---|---|
|**Focus**|Cost per QALY is low|Total national spend may be high|
|**Purpose**|Justifies value-for-money|Assesses affordability and fiscal space|
|**Use Case**|Suitable for HTA decisions|Weighs against competing priorities|

- **Fiscal space**: A government‚Äôs capacity to fund additional spending without jeopardizing financial stability.
- **Policy question**: Policymakers ask not only ‚ÄúIs it worth it per patient?‚Äù but also ‚ÄúCan we afford it for everyone who needs it?‚Äù

### Policy Trade-Offs

When evaluating interventions, consider:

- **Fiscal Space**: Is the intervention within the MOH budget?
- **Opportunity Cost**: What other services would be displaced?
- **Implementation Feasibility**: Is the delivery infrastructure in place?

An intervention must be **both cost-effective and affordable** to be implementable at scale.

## Lessons from the ICER Exercise üìù

The exercise highlights key principles for applying ICERs in policy:

- **ICER is not the only factor**. All three interventions had ICERs near or below the threshold, but choices varied based on context.
- **Budget impact changes the story**. A cost-effective program can still be unaffordable at scale.
- **Feasibility matters**. Some interventions require significant system investments (e.g., IT, trained staff).
- **Equity and access influence value judgments**. Reaching vulnerable groups may justify higher costs.

**Core Principle**: Economic evaluations provide **evidence, not answers**. Good policymaking relies on **interpretation, trade-offs, and values**.
