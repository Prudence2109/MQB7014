# üìö 1. Introduction to Applying Economic Evaluation

**Economic Evaluation IV** shifts the focus from understanding and critiquing **economic evaluations** to their **application in policy and practice**. Delivered on **June 19, 2025**, this lecture explores how to use **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs)**, **case-mix/Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) costing**, and **Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) analysis** to inform **health policy decisions**, particularly in Malaysia‚Äôs context. The session emphasizes **real-world complexities**, including **budget constraints**, **feasibility**, and **equity**, to ensure evaluations are **policy-relevant**.

### üéØ Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, students should be able to:
- **Interpret ICERs** in the context of **Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) thresholds** and **budget impact**.
- **Explain** the role of **case-mix/DRG costing** in national-level **health financing** and **economic evaluations**.
- **Compare** different **WTP thresholds**, including **GDP-based** and **stated preference methods**.
- **Apply** economic evaluation results using **structured exercises** to simulate **policy decision-making**.

## ü©∫ 2. From Numbers to Policy Decisions

### üìñ Overview

- **Focus**: Moving beyond **technical calculations** to using economic evaluations in the **complex world of policy**.
- **Key Question**: *How do we use economic evaluations to make real-world decisions?*
- **Topics Covered**:
  - **Interpreting ICERs** against **WTP thresholds** and **budget constraints**.
  - Understanding **case-mix/DRG costing** at scale.
  - Making decisions based on **affordability**, **feasibility**, and **equity**, beyond just ICERs.
- **Key Message**: *Today isn‚Äôt about learning more techniques. It‚Äôs about understanding how to use them in the messy, complex world of policy.*

### üìú Key Takeaway

- *‚ÄúA low ICER is a good start but it‚Äôs not the finish line. Policy decisions need more than just maths.‚Äù*
- **Decision Framework**:
  - **ICER < Threshold?** ‚Üí Evaluate if cost-effective.
  - **Consider Budget?** ‚Üí Assess affordability within resource constraints.
  - **Consider Feasibility?** ‚Üí Evaluate implementation readiness.
  - **Final Funding Decision**: Balances **value for money**, **budget**, and **contextual factors**.

## üìà 3. Interpreting ICERs

### üìñ What is an ICER?

- **Definition**: The **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** compares two options:
  $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{New}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{Comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{New}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{Comparator}}} $$
  - **Numerator**: Incremental cost (RM).
  - **Denominator**: Incremental effectiveness (e.g., QALYs gained).
- **Purpose**: Indicates **how much extra** is paid per additional unit of outcome (e.g., per QALY gained).

### üìã Why a Good ICER Isn‚Äôt Enough

- A **low ICER** (below threshold) suggests **cost-effectiveness**, but **policy decisions** require additional considerations:
  - **Budget Impact**: Can the health system afford the intervention?
  - **Feasibility**: Is the infrastructure in place for implementation?
  - **Equity**: Does it address priority populations or reduce disparities?
  - **Urgency**: Can it be implemented within required timelines?

### üìä Decision Framework

- **Flowchart** (from Slide 8):
  - **Step 1**: Is ICER < **WTP threshold**? (Yes/No)
  - **Step 2**: Consider **budget constraints**.
  - **Step 3**: Assess **feasibility** (e.g., infrastructure, readiness).
  - **Step 4**: Make **final funding decision** based on all factors.
- **Insight**: Even **cost-effective** interventions may be rejected if **unaffordable** or **infeasible**.

## üí∞ 4. Case-Mix/DRG Costing

### üìñ Overview

- **Case-Mix/DRG Costing**: A method to standardize **cost estimation** in healthcare by grouping patients based on **diagnosis**, **procedures**, and **comorbidities**, widely used in **national health financing** and **economic evaluations**.
- **Malaysia Context**: Implemented in **Ministry of Health (MOH)** and **university hospitals** using the **UNU-CBG Grouper** to generate **DRG codes**.

### üìã DRG Costing Process

1. **Patient Classification**: Based on **diagnosis**, **procedures**, and **comorbidities**.
2. **DRG Assignment**: Patient assigned to a **Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG)**.
3. **Cost Weight**: Each DRG has a **relative cost weight** (e.g., Appendectomy = 0.85, Stroke = 1.7).
4. **Cost Calculation**: Multiply **DRG weight** by **national base rate** to estimate cost per case.
5. **Application**: Use cost estimates for **reimbursement**, **budgeting**, or **economic evaluation inputs**.

### üìä Base Rate Formula

- **Formula**:
  $$ \text{BR}_t = \frac{\text{HP}_t}{\text{Cases}_{h, t-1}} $$
  - **BR$_t$**: Base rate in year t.
  - **HP$_t$**: Hospital pool (budget allocated to hospital h in year t).
  - **Cases$_{h, t-1}$**: Total number of patients in hospital h in year t-1.
- **Explanation**: The base rate depends on the **budget allocated** and the **number of patients treated**, ensuring costs reflect hospital activity.

### üåç Malaysia‚Äôs Use of DRG

- **Implementation**: 
  - **UNU-CBG Grouper** generates DRG codes for MOH and university hospitals.
  - Supports **internal costing studies** and **MaHTAS economic evaluations**.
  - **Cost per episode** preferred over **itemized billing** for **generalizability**.
- **Challenges** (from Slide 32, Business Times article):
  - Malaysia‚Äôs **tax-funded**, **subsidized** public healthcare system relies on **budget line items** and is **supply-driven**, not suited for **activity-based** or **case-based payments** like DRG.
  - **Significant groundwork** needed:
    - **Standardized digital health systems** for interoperable **electronic medical records**.
    - **Training** for policymakers, hospital management, and clinicians on DRG use.
    - **Stakeholder engagement** with administrators, clinicians, and professional bodies.
  - **Timeline**: Could take **up to 5 years** to implement DRG payments due to:
    - **Irregular IT infrastructure** (decades behind).
    - Need for **transparency** and **fairness** in determining DRG tariffs.
  - **Quote**: *‚ÄúA large part of the IT infrastructure is irregular and decades behind,‚Äù* ‚Äì Azrul (Business Times).

### üìä DRG vs. Micro-Costing

| **Approach** | **Description** | **Strengths** | **Limitations** |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **DRG/Case-Mix** | Groups patients by diagnosis/procedures for standardized costs | Generalizable, scalable for national budgeting | Less precise, averages costs |
| **Micro-Costing** | Itemizes and values each resource in detail | High precision, ideal for clinical trials | Time-consuming, less scalable |

## üìä 5. Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) Analysis

### üìñ What is Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)?

- **Definition**: The **maximum amount** a health system or society is willing to pay for an additional unit of health gain (e.g., 1 QALY).
- **Use in Policy**: Guides **resource allocation** by comparing **ICERs** to WTP thresholds to determine **cost-effectiveness**.

### üìã Why WTP is Useful

- **Role**: Helps policymakers decide whether an intervention‚Äôs **cost per outcome** is **acceptable** given **budget constraints** and **societal values**.
- **Slide 34**: Labeled ‚ÄúWhy WTP is useful in policy,‚Äù but content is missing, likely an OCR error. Assumed to emphasize WTP‚Äôs role in prioritizing interventions.

### üìä How is WTP Measured?

- **Methods**:

| **Method** | **Explanation** |
|------------|-----------------|
| **1‚Äì3√ó GDP per Capita** | Early WHO-CHOICE guidance (e.g., Malaysia: RM 48,000‚Äì144,000 per QALY) |
| **WTP Studies (CV/DCE)** | Surveys of how much individuals/society would pay for a QALY (e.g., Contingent Valuation, Discrete Choice Experiments) |
| **Historical Benchmarks** | Based on past funding decisions (revealed preferences) |
| **Deliberative Process** | HTA panels or policy consensus (e.g., Thailand‚Äôs HTA committee) |
- **Malaysia Context**:
  - **GDP-Based Threshold**: ~RM 48,000‚Äì144,000 per QALY (based on 2025 GDP estimates).
  - **Critique**: GDP-based thresholds are **simplistic**, ignoring **budget constraints** and **opportunity costs**.

### üìà Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE)

- **Purpose**: Quantifies how people **trade money for health** to estimate **WTP**.
- **Process** (Slide 39):
  - Respondents choose between options (e.g., **Option A** with higher cost but better outcomes).
  - **Example**: If many choose **Option A** despite higher cost, estimate **extra RM** willing to pay for:
    - **20% improvement** in effectiveness.
    - **Avoiding side effects**.
  - Use a **larger sample** and **multiple choice sets** with a **regression model** (e.g., conditional logit) to:
    - Estimate **WTP per unit** of improvement (e.g., RM per 1% reduction in death).
    - Convert to **RM per QALY** (with assumptions about utility and life-years).
- **Insight**: DCEs provide **real-world WTP values** by capturing **trade-offs**.

## üß† 6. Policy Application Exercise

### üìñ Overview

- **Scenario**: Advising the **Ministry of Health** on which intervention to fund, considering **ICERs**, **WTP thresholds**, **budget impact**, **equity**, and **feasibility**.
- **Class Discussion Questions**:
  - Which **ICERs** are below the **WTP threshold**?
  - Which intervention has the **most favorable ICER**?
  - Does **budget impact** change the recommendation?
  - What if **equity** is a policy priority?
  - What if the program must be implemented within **12 months**?
- **Key Insight**: *No right or wrong answer, but the rationale is key.* Policy decisions involve **contextual trade-offs**:
  - **Affordability**: Fits within current MOH budget?
  - **Scale**: Can it be implemented nationally?
  - **Feasibility**: Is delivery infrastructure in place?
  - **Equity**: Does it benefit marginalized groups?
  - **Urgency**: Can it meet time constraints?

### üìä Budget Impact Considerations

- **M1**: Is the intervention within the **current MOH budget**?
- **M2**: What **other services** would be displaced if funded?
- **M3**: Is the **delivery infrastructure** in place?
- **Note**: Slide 18‚Äôs incomplete text (‚ÄúJust-1-1-1‚Ä¶‚Äù) likely refers to budget impact analysis, but no specific data is provided.

### üìú When Policymakers Deviate from ICER Rules

- **Scenarios** (Slide 41):

| **Scenario** | **Common Justification** |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| **End-of-Life Care** | Societal duty to support dignity, even if cost is high |
| **Rare Diseases/Orphan Drugs** | High cost per QALY, but high unmet need |
| **Marginalized Populations** | Priority to reduce health inequities |
| **Childhood Interventions** | Perceived lifetime benefit or moral imperative |
- **Insight**: Policymakers may prioritize interventions despite **high ICERs** due to **ethical**, **social**, or **equity** considerations.
