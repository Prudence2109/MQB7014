## 🔢 Calculation-based Questions

These questions assess **quantitative skills** using data from the lecture’s USA vs. UK comparison. Each includes formulas, calculations, and explanations.

### 1. Health Expenditure Comparison

**Question**: Given the USA’s health expenditure is $16.9%$ of GDP and the UK’s is $10.0%$ in 2018, calculate the **difference in percentage points**. If Malaysia’s health expenditure is $4.4%$ of GDP, how much lower is it than the UK’s in percentage points?

- **Formula**:
    - Difference in percentage points: $P_1 - P_2$
    - Where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are percentages for the two countries.
- **Calculation**:
    - USA vs. UK: $16.9% - 10.0% = 6.9%$
    - Malaysia vs. UK: $10.0% - 4.4% = 5.6%$
- **Explanation**:
    - The **difference in percentage points** measures the absolute gap between health expenditures as a share of GDP. The USA spends $6.9$ percentage points more than the UK, reflecting its **market-based system’s** higher costs (lecture, Section 7). Malaysia’s $4.4%$ (external data, as lecture cites GDP per capita but not health expenditure percentage) is $5.6$ percentage points lower than the UK’s, indicating a leaner but potentially underfunded system, aligning with its **dual public-private model** prioritizing **equity** through subsidies. 📊

### 2. Per Capita Expenditure Analysis

**Question**: The USA’s health expenditure per capita (PPP, 2018) is $10624$, while the UK’s is $4620$. Calculate the **ratio** of USA to UK per capita expenditure. If Malaysia’s per capita expenditure is estimated at $1100$, what is the ratio of Malaysia to UK?

- **Formula**:
    - Ratio: $\frac{E_1}{E_2}$
    - Where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are per capita expenditures.
- **Calculation**:
    - USA:UK = $\frac{10624}{4620} \approx 2.299 \approx 2.3$ (rounded to one decimal place).
    - Malaysia:UK = $\frac{1100}{4620} \approx 0.238 \approx 0.24$ (rounded to two decimal places for precision).
- **Explanation**:
    - The **ratio** shows relative spending levels. The USA’s expenditure is $2.3$ times higher than the UK’s, reflecting its **high-cost, private-driven system** (Section 7). Malaysia’s $1100$ (estimated, as lecture does not provide this figure) is only $0.24$ times the UK’s, indicating lower investment per person, consistent with its **middle-income status** and reliance on public subsidies to achieve **equity**. This gap highlights challenges in funding advanced care in Malaysia’s **dual system**. 💰

### 3. Life Expectancy Gap

**Question**: The UK’s total life expectancy at birth (2019) is $81.2$ years, and the USA’s is $78.8$ years. Calculate the **difference** in years. If Malaysia’s life expectancy is $72$ years, how much lower is it than the UK’s?

- **Formula**:
    - Difference: $L_1 - L_2$
    - Where $L_1$ and $L_2$ are life expectancy values.
- **Calculation**:
    - UK:USA = $81.2 - 78.8 = 2.4$ years.
    - Malaysia:UK = $81.2 - 72 = 9.2$ years.
- **Explanation**:
    - The **difference** in life expectancy reflects health system effectiveness. The UK’s $2.4$-year advantage over the USA (Section 7) suggests better **equity** and **access** through the **NHS**, despite lower spending. Malaysia’s $72$ years (Section 4) is $9.2$ years below the UK, indicating progress in its **dual system** but gaps due to resource constraints and non-communicable disease burdens. Government interventions like **Klinik Kesihatan** aim to close this gap by improving **population health**. 🧬

### 4. Infant Mortality Rate Comparison

**Question**: The UK’s infant mortality rate (2018) is $3.7$ per 1,000 live births, and the USA’s (2019) is $5.6$. Calculate the **percentage increase** from UK to USA.

- **Formula**:
    - Percentage increase: $\frac{R_2 - R_1}{R_1} \times 100$
    - Where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the infant mortality rates for UK and USA.
- **Calculation**:
    - Difference: $5.6 - 3.7 = 1.9$
    - Percentage increase: $\frac{1.9}{3.7} \times 100 \approx 51.351% \approx 51.35%$ (rounded to two decimal places).
- **Explanation**:
    - The **percentage increase** shows the relative rise in infant mortality from the UK to the USA. The $51.35%$ higher rate in the USA (Section 7) reflects challenges in its **market-based system**, such as **insurance gaps** affecting maternal and child health. The UK’s **NHS**, with **universal coverage**, achieves better outcomes through equitable access. Malaysia, with similar public health efforts, could use this data to benchmark improvements in **infant mortality** through subsidized care. 👶

### 5. Nurse-to-Population Ratio

**Question**: The UK has $8.2$ nurses per 1,000 population (2018), and the USA has $14.5$ (2017). Calculate the **difference** in nurses per 1,000 and express it as a percentage of the UK’s ratio.

- **Formula**:
    - Difference: $N_2 - N_1$
    - Percentage of UK’s ratio: $\frac{N_2 - N_1}{N_1} \times 100$
    - Where $N_1$ and $N_2$ are nurses per 1,000 for UK and USA.
- **Calculation**:
    - Difference: $14.5 - 8.2 = 6.3$
    - Percentage of UK: $\frac{6.3}{8.2} \times 100 \approx 76.829% \approx 76.83%$ (rounded to two decimal places).
- **Explanation**:
    - The **difference** of $6.3$ nurses per 1,000 shows the USA’s higher nursing capacity, likely due to its **high expenditure** (Section 7). The $76.83%$ increase relative to the UK’s ratio highlights resource disparities. However, the UK’s **NHS** achieves better outcomes (e.g., higher life expectancy) through efficient resource use. Malaysia could analyze such ratios to optimize its **nurse workforce** in **Klinik Kesihatan**, balancing **cost** and **quality**. 🩺

## ✍️ Short-Essay Questions

These questions (150–200 words) require **application** of concepts to practical scenarios, demonstrating **problem-solving skills**. Each includes a detailed answer grounded in the lecture.

### 1. Moral Hazard in the USA and Malaysia’s Strategy

**Question**: Discuss how **moral hazard** contributes to cost escalation in the USA’s healthcare system, using examples from the lecture, and propose one strategy Malaysia could adopt to mitigate similar issues in its private sector.

- **Answer**:
    - **Moral hazard** occurs when insured individuals **overuse services** due to reduced **perceived costs**, inflating healthcare expenses (Section 5). In the USA, **over-reliance on insurance** leads to unnecessary consultations or tests, driven by low out-of-pocket costs (Section 7). For example, insured patients may seek frequent specialist visits, escalating costs ($16.9%$ of GDP in 2018). This contributes to **cost escalation**, compounded by **provider-induced demand** (e.g., unnecessary tests), as providers benefit financially. Malaysia’s **private sector**, with corporate insurance plans, faces similar risks, where employees overuse clinic visits (Section 5). To mitigate this, Malaysia could implement **co-payments** for private clinic visits, requiring patients to bear a small portion of costs (e.g., $10$ RM per visit). This discourages unnecessary consultations while maintaining access, aligning with **WHO’s financial protection goal** (Section 6). By balancing **cost control** with **equity**, Malaysia can prevent cost escalation seen in the USA, ensuring sustainable private sector growth. 📉

### 2. Separation of Prescribing and Dispensing

**Question**: Explain how the **separation of drug prescribing and dispensing** in Malaysia’s private GP practices could address **provider-induced demand**, and identify one challenge and solution for rural areas.

- **Answer**:
    - The **separation of prescribing and dispensing** in Malaysia’s private GP practices tackles **provider-induced demand**, where GPs over-prescribe to boost revenue from dispensing (Section 2). By limiting GPs to **prescribing** and assigning **dispensing** to pharmacists, the policy removes **financial incentives** for unnecessary or costly drugs, ensuring prescriptions align with **clinical need** (Section 5). This enhances **patient safety** and supports **WHO’s health improvement goal** (Section 6). A key **challenge** in **rural Malaysia** is scarce pharmacies, potentially reducing **access** and **equity** for patients reliant on GPs’ one-stop services (Section 2). A **solution** is deploying **mobile pharmacies**, which deliver medications to rural areas, as proposed in the lecture. This ensures **fair access** while maintaining separation benefits, such as **cost control** through generic drugs. By addressing **provider-induced demand** and rural access, the policy strengthens Malaysia’s **dual system**, promoting **equity** and **efficiency**. 🚚

### 3. Government Financing in UK and Malaysia

**Question**: Compare the role of **government financing** in the UK’s NHS and Malaysia’s public healthcare, focusing on how each promotes **equity** for vulnerable groups.

- **Answer**:
    - **Government financing** in the **UK’s NHS** relies on **general taxation** and **national insurance**, providing **free-at-point-of-service** care based on **need**, not ability to pay (Section 7). This ensures **equity** for vulnerable groups like the elderly and low-income, with $78.6%$ of expenditure from government funds (2018). Malaysia’s **public healthcare** uses **subsidies** to offer low-cost care through **Klinik Kesihatan** and public hospitals, targeting the **poor** and **rural populations** (Section 6). Both systems prioritize **equity** (Whitehead, 1990), but the UK’s **universal coverage** contrasts with Malaysia’s **dual system**, where private care supplements public services. Malaysia’s financing corrects **market failures** like underprovision for the poor, while the NHS addresses **insurance gaps**. Malaysia could enhance **equity** by expanding subsidies for rural clinics, learning from the NHS’s comprehensive approach, ensuring **fair access** for all (Section 8). 🏥

### 4. Malaysia’s Smoking Bans

**Question**: Describe how **Malaysia’s smoking bans** address **negative externalities**, and suggest one additional policy to further reduce tobacco-related health costs.

- **Answer**:
    - **Malaysia’s smoking bans** address **negative externalities** by reducing **secondhand smoke**, which harms non-smokers and increases healthcare costs (Section 5). These bans, enforced in public spaces, mitigate the **external costs** of smoking, such as respiratory diseases, aligning with **Pigouvian tax** principles to internalize societal costs (Section 7). By limiting exposure, bans promote **public health**, contributing to **WHO’s health improvement goal** (Section 6). An additional policy could be **increasing sin taxes** on tobacco products, building on Malaysia’s existing taxes (Section 5). Higher taxes (e.g., $2$ RM per pack increase) discourage consumption, further reducing **negative externalities** like hospital admissions for smoking-related illnesses. This complements bans by targeting individual behavior, generating revenue for health programs, and enhancing **equity** by protecting vulnerable groups from tobacco-related harm, as seen in global anti-tobacco strategies. 🚬

### 5. Economies of Scale in Malaysia’s MCOs

**Question**: Analyze how **economies of scale** in Malaysia’s Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) impact healthcare costs, and propose a policy to balance **cost reduction** with **quality assurance**.

- **Answer**:
    - **Economies of scale** in Malaysia’s **Managed Care Organizations (MCOs)** reduce **unit costs** by spreading fixed expenses (e.g., equipment) over more patients, as larger providers integrate services (Section 5). This lowers costs in urban areas, but **monopolistic tendencies** may increase prices or compromise quality if unchecked. For example, MCOs’ adoption of **high-tech medicine** attracts patients but raises costs (Section 5). To balance **cost reduction** with **quality assurance**, Malaysia could adopt a **regulatory framework** inspired by the UK’s **NICE**, mandating **cost-effectiveness reviews** for MCO treatments (Section 7). This policy ensures affordable, evidence-based care without sacrificing quality, promoting **equity** for low-income patients (Section 8). Regular audits and quality benchmarks would maintain standards, aligning with **WHO’s expectation-meeting goal**, ensuring Malaysia’s **dual system** remains efficient and equitable. 🔬

### 🔢 Calculation-based Questions: Applying Quantitative Skills 📊

These questions test the ability to apply **economic evaluation** principles through calculations, focusing on the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** and cost-effectiveness analysis.

#### 1. Calculating ICER for a New Drug

**Question**: A new diabetes drug costs **RM 20,000** per patient and provides **5 life years**, while standard care costs **RM 12,000** and provides **4 life years**.

- Calculate the **ICER** using the formula: $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\Delta \text{Cost}}{\Delta \text{Effectiveness}} $$
- Interpret whether the new drug is cost-effective if Malaysia’s threshold is **RM 30,000 per life year gained**.

**Answer**:

- **Step 1: Calculate the ICER**  
    The **ICER** measures the additional cost per additional unit of effectiveness. The formula is:  
    $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\Delta \text{Cost}}{\Delta \text{Effectiveness}} $$  
    where (\Delta \text{Cost}) is the difference in costs, and (\Delta \text{Effectiveness}) is the difference in outcomes (life years).
    
    - **Costs**: New drug = RM 20,000, Standard care = RM 12,000
        - (\Delta \text{Cost} = 20,000 - 12,000 = \text{RM 8,000})
    - **Effectiveness**: New drug = 5 life years, Standard care = 4 life years
        - (\Delta \text{Effectiveness} = 5 - 4 = 1 \text{ life year})
    - **ICER Calculation**:  
        $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{8,000}{1} = \text{RM 8,000 per life year gained} $$
- **Step 2: Interpret Cost-Effectiveness**  
    Malaysia’s threshold is **RM 30,000 per life year gained**, meaning interventions with an ICER below this value are considered cost-effective.
    
    - The calculated **ICER** of **RM 8,000 per life year** is well below the threshold of **RM 30,000**.
    - **Conclusion**: The new diabetes drug is **cost-effective**, as its additional cost per life year gained is significantly lower than Malaysia’s willingness-to-pay threshold, making it a viable option for adoption in the **MyHEALTH** formulary.

#### 2. Comparing Screening Programs

**Question**: A breast cancer screening program costs **RM 500,000** and detects **50 cases**, while an alternative program costs **RM 600,000** and detects **60 cases**.

- Calculate the **ICER** for the alternative program compared to the original.
- If Malaysia’s health system values a detected case at **RM 15,000**, is the alternative program cost-effective?

**Answer**:

- **Step 1: Calculate the ICER**  
    Using the formula:  
    $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\Delta \text{Cost}}{\Delta \text{Effectiveness}} $$
    
    - **Costs**: Original program = RM 500,000, Alternative program = RM 600,000
        - (\Delta \text{Cost} = 600,000 - 500,000 = \text{RM 100,000})
    - **Effectiveness**: Original program = 50 cases, Alternative program = 60 cases
        - (\Delta \text{Effectiveness} = 60 - 50 = 10 \text{ cases detected})
    - **ICER Calculation**:  
        $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{100,000}{10} = \text{RM 10,000 per case detected} $$
- **Step 2: Interpret Cost-Effectiveness**  
    The health system values a detected case at **RM 15,000**, indicating the threshold for cost-effectiveness.
    
    - The **ICER** of **RM 10,000 per case detected** is below the threshold of **RM 15,000**.
    - **Conclusion**: The alternative screening program is **cost-effective**, as it detects additional cases at a cost lower than the health system’s valuation, supporting its potential adoption for **national health screening guidelines** in Malaysia.

#### 3. Cost-Utility Analysis for a Vaccine

**Question**: A new vaccine costs **RM 1,000,000** and generates **10,000 QALYs**, while the current vaccine costs **RM 800,000** and generates **9,500 QALYs**.

- Calculate the **ICER** in terms of cost per QALY gained.
- Determine if the new vaccine is cost-effective, assuming a **MaHTAS** threshold of **RM 50,000 per QALY**.

**Answer**:

- **Step 1: Calculate the ICER**  
    Using the formula:  
    $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{\Delta \text{Cost}}{\Delta \text{Effectiveness}} $$
    
    - **Costs**: New vaccine = RM 1,000,000, Current vaccine = RM 800,000
        - (\Delta \text{Cost} = 1,000,000 - 800,000 = \text{RM 200,000})
    - **Effectiveness**: New vaccine = 10,000 QALYs, Current vaccine = 9,500 QALYs
        - (\Delta \text{Effectiveness} = 10,000 - 9,500 = 500 \text{ QALYs})
    - **ICER Calculation**:  
        $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{200,000}{500} = \text{RM 400 per QALY gained} $$
- **Step 2: Interpret Cost-Effectiveness**  
    The **MaHTAS** threshold is **RM 50,000 per QALY**, a benchmark for cost-effectiveness in Malaysia’s **HTA** process.

    - **Conclusion**: The new vaccine is **highly cost-effective**, as its cost per QALY gained is minimal compared to the threshold, making it a strong candidate for inclusion in Malaysia’s **Vaccination Programme** to support **UHC** goals.

#### 4. Budget Impact Analysis

**Question**: A new treatment for hypertension costs **RM 5,000 per patient** and is expected to treat **1,000 patients annually**. The current treatment costs **RM 3,000 per patient**.

- Calculate the **additional annual budget** required to adopt the new treatment.
- If the health system’s budget increase is limited to **RM 1,500,000**, can it afford the new treatment?

**Answer**:

- **Step 1: Calculate the Additional Annual Budget**
    
    - **Cost per patient**: New treatment = RM 5,000, Current treatment = RM 3,000
        - Additional cost per patient = (5,000 - 3,000 = \text{RM 2,000})
    - **Number of patients**: 1,000 annually
    - **Total additional budget**:  
        $$ \text{Additional Budget} = \text{Additional Cost per Patient} \times \text{Number of Patients} = 2,000 \times 1,000 = \text{RM 2,000,000} $$
- **Step 2: Assess Affordability**  
    The health system’s budget increase is limited to **RM 1,500,000**.
    
    - The **additional annual budget** of **RM 2,000,000** exceeds the available budget increase of **RM 1,500,000**.
    - **Conclusion**: The health system **cannot afford** the new treatment without exceeding its budget limit. Policymakers should consider **opportunity costs** (e.g., what other programs would be cut) or negotiate lower costs to make the treatment feasible.

#### 5. Cost-Minimization Analysis for Generic Drugs

**Question**: Two bioequivalent generic drugs for malaria have identical outcomes. Drug A costs **RM 100 per treatment**, and Drug B costs **RM 80 per treatment** for **10,000 treatments annually**.

- Calculate the **annual cost savings** by choosing Drug B over Drug A.
- Explain why **CMA** is appropriate for this scenario.

**Answer**:

- **Step 1: Calculate Annual Cost Savings**
    
    - **Cost per treatment**: Drug A = RM 100, Drug B = RM 80
        - Cost difference per treatment = (100 - 80 = \text{RM 20})
    - **Number of treatments**: 10,000 annually
    - **Total cost savings**:  
        $$ \text{Cost Savings} = \text{Cost Difference per Treatment} \times \text{Number of Treatments} = 20 \times 10,000 = \text{RM 200,000} $$
- **Step 2: Explain Why CMA is Appropriate**
    
    - **CMA** is used when **two or more interventions have proven identical outcomes**, focusing solely on **cost differences**. In this scenario, the drugs are **bioequivalent**, meaning their health outcomes (e.g., malaria cure rates) are identical, making **CMA** the appropriate method.
    - By choosing Drug B, Malaysia’s health system saves **RM 200,000 annually**, which can be redirected to other high-impact programs like **Peka B40**. This aligns with **technical efficiency**, ensuring the same health outcome at a lower cost 💊.

### ✍️ Short-Essay Questions: Applying Concepts to Practical Scenarios 📝

These questions require concise responses (200–300 words) applying **economic evaluation** principles to practical scenarios, demonstrating **conceptual understanding** and **problem-solving skills**.

#### 1. Applying Opportunity Cost in Malaysia’s Health System

**Question**: Explain how **opportunity cost** influences healthcare decisions in Malaysia, using the example of choosing between funding a **new dialysis center** or a **diabetes prevention program**. Discuss the trade-offs and how economic evaluation can guide the decision.

**Answer**:  
**Opportunity cost**, defined as _the value of the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made_, is a core principle in healthcare due to **scarcity** of resources. In Malaysia, choosing to fund a **new dialysis center** over a **diabetes prevention program** illustrates this concept. A dialysis center addresses immediate needs for kidney failure patients, costing, say, **RM 5 million** annually to treat 500 patients. However, this means forgoing a diabetes prevention program that could cost **RM 4 million** and prevent 1,000 cases, reducing future dialysis demand. The **trade-off** is between **acute care** (dialysis) and **long-term prevention** (diabetes control), impacting different patient groups and health outcomes.

**Economic evaluation** guides this decision by comparing **costs** and **consequences**. A **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)** could assess **cost per life year gained** for dialysis versus **cost per case prevented** for the prevention program. If the prevention program has a lower **ICER** (e.g., RM 4,000/case prevented vs. RM 10,000/life year for dialysis), it may offer better **value for money**. A **societal perspective** would include **indirect costs** (e.g., productivity losses) and **intangible costs** (e.g., patient quality of life), favoring prevention if it reduces long-term burden. By quantifying **opportunity costs**, economic evaluation ensures Malaysia’s health system prioritizes interventions that maximize **health gains** within budget constraints, supporting **UHC** goals. This approach is globally relevant, as health systems balance **short-term needs** with **preventive strategies** to optimize resources 🌍.

#### 2. Choosing the Right Perspective for Peka B40

**Question**: Discuss why the **patient perspective** is critical when evaluating the **Peka B40** program in Malaysia. Explain how it differs from the **health system perspective** and why both are relevant for **UHC** goals.

**Answer**:  
The **patient perspective** in economic evaluation, which focuses on **out-of-pocket (OOP) costs**, **travel**, **food**, **lodging**, and **income loss**, is critical for evaluating Malaysia’s **Peka B40** program, which subsidizes healthcare for low-income groups. This perspective highlights **financial hardship** and **catastrophic health spending**, ensuring **equity** by assessing whether subsidies reduce burdens for vulnerable populations. For example, a **Peka B40** beneficiary accessing subsidized cancer screening may still face **travel costs** to urban clinics or **income loss** from missed work, which could deter participation. Evaluating these costs ensures the program is accessible, aligning with **UHC** goals of equitable access.

In contrast, the **health system perspective** focuses on **direct medical costs** (e.g., **hospital stays**, **medications**, **staff time**) borne by Malaysia’s public health system. It excludes **OOP costs** and **productivity losses**, prioritizing **budget planning** and **HTA** via **MaHTAS**. For **Peka B40**, this perspective assesses whether subsidies are sustainable within the **Ministry of Health** budget. Both perspectives are relevant for **UHC**: the **patient perspective** ensures affordability, while the **health system perspective** ensures fiscal **sustainability**. A **societal perspective** could integrate both, capturing total impact but requiring more data. By balancing these perspectives, economic evaluation ensures **Peka B40** maximizes **health equity** and **efficiency**, a model applicable to global low-income health programs 🌍.

#### 3. When to Conduct Economic Evaluation

**Question**: Describe a scenario where Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health** should conduct an economic evaluation (e.g., introducing a new vaccine) and one where it should avoid it (e.g., uncertain outcomes). Explain the importance of **timing** and **data quality**.

**Answer**:  
**Economic evaluation** is crucial when Malaysia’s **Ministry of Health** faces **resource allocation decisions**, such as introducing a new **dengue vaccine**. This scenario involves a **new intervention** with significant costs and potential benefits (e.g., reducing dengue cases). A **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)** using **QALYs** can assess whether the vaccine’s cost (e.g., RM 10 million for 100,000 doses) justifies its health impact (e.g., 5,000 QALYs gained), guiding inclusion in the **Vaccination Programme**. **Timing** is critical to align with **budgeting cycles** or **MaHTAS** HTA reviews, ensuring decisions are informed by **evidence** and maximize **health gains**.

Conversely, economic evaluation should be avoided when **outcomes are unknown or highly uncertain**, such as for a new experimental drug with limited clinical trial data. Without reliable **effectiveness data** (e.g., uncertain survival rates), evaluations are speculative, risking misleading conclusions. **Data quality** is essential, as high-quality evidence ensures **credible** results. For example, evaluating a drug without proven efficacy wastes resources and delays decisions. **Timing** matters to align with **planning cycles**, ensuring evaluations inform **policy**, **procurement**, or **program expansion**. This principle applies globally, ensuring health systems like Malaysia’s prioritize **evidence-based** interventions for **UHC** 🌍.

#### 4. Efficiency in Resource Allocation

**Question**: Explain the difference between **technical efficiency** and **allocative efficiency** using Malaysia-specific examples (e.g., generic drugs, vaccination programs). Discuss how these concepts ensure **value for money** in healthcare.

**Answer**:  
**Efficiency** in healthcare, defined as _achieving maximum benefit from available resources_, is critical for **value for money**. **Technical efficiency** involves producing a given output at the **lowest cost**. In Malaysia, using **generic drugs** instead of branded ones for hypertension (e.g., RM 10 vs. RM 50 per prescription) achieves the same health outcome (blood pressure control) at lower cost, saving resources for programs like **Peka B40**. **Allocative efficiency** allocates resources to **maximize population health**. For example, prioritizing **HPV vaccination programs** over rare-disease treatments prevents more cervical cancer cases, benefiting a larger population within Malaysia’s budget constraints.

Both types ensure **value for money** by optimizing resource use. **Technical efficiency** reduces wasteful spending, allowing funds to support additional services (e.g., more screenings). **Allocative efficiency** directs resources to high-impact interventions, aligning with **UHC** goals. Economic evaluation, such as **CEA** for vaccinations (e.g., cost per case prevented), quantifies these efficiencies, ensuring Malaysia’s health system delivers **more health gains per Ringgit**. Globally, these concepts guide health systems to balance **cost** and **impact**, ensuring **equitable** and **sustainable** healthcare delivery 🌍.

#### 5. Selecting the Appropriate Evaluation Type

**Question**: A new cancer drug is being considered for Malaysia’s **MyHEALTH** formulary. Discuss whether **CUA** or **CEA** is more appropriate, justifying your choice based on **outcome measures** and **HTA** requirements.

**Answer**:  
For a new cancer drug considered for Malaysia’s **MyHEALTH** formulary, **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)** is more appropriate than **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)** due to its **outcome measures** and alignment with **HTA** requirements. **CUA** uses **utility-based measures** like **QALYs** (Quality-Adjusted Life Years), capturing both **quantity** and **quality of life**. Cancer drugs often extend life but cause side effects (e.g., nausea), impacting patient well-being. **CUA** quantifies these trade-offs (e.g., RM 100,000/QALY), making it ideal for **MaHTAS** evaluations, which prioritize comprehensive outcomes for **HTA**.

**CEA** uses **natural units** like **life years gained** (e.g., RM 50,000/life year), suitable when **quality of life** is not the primary focus. However, for cancer treatments, quality of life is critical due to side effects, making **CEA** less suitable. **CUA** aligns with **MaHTAS** standards, ensuring the drug’s **value for money** is assessed holistically. For example, a drug extending life by 1 year but reducing quality due to toxicity may have a high **ICER** in **CUA**, guiding rejection if above Malaysia’s threshold (e.g., RM 50,000/QALY). Globally, **CUA** is preferred for **HTA**, ensuring **patient-centered** decisions 🌍.

#### 1. Optimizing Malaysia’s Peka B40 Program with Economic Evaluation

**Question**: Discuss how **economic evaluation** can enhance the **Peka B40** program, which provides healthcare subsidies for low-income groups in Malaysia. Analyze the role of **perspective** (societal vs. patient) and **evaluation types** (e.g., **CUA**, **CEA**) in assessing its cost-effectiveness. Propose **policy recommendations** to ensure **equity** and **efficiency**, drawing on **economic principles** like **scarcity** and **opportunity cost**, and discuss global implications for similar programs.

**Answer**:  
**Economic evaluation**, defined as _a comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences_ (Drummond et al., 2005), is a powerful tool to enhance Malaysia’s **Peka B40** program, which subsidizes healthcare for low-income groups. By assessing **value for money**, it ensures **scarcity**—limited resources against unlimited health needs—is addressed through **efficient** and **equitable** resource allocation. **Peka B40** provides free screenings and treatments, but its effectiveness depends on balancing costs with health outcomes, particularly for vulnerable populations. Economic evaluation, through appropriate **perspectives** and **evaluation types**, can optimize its impact, aligning with **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)** goals.

The **patient perspective** is critical for **Peka B40**, as it includes **out-of-pocket (OOP) costs** (e.g., travel, co-payments), **income loss**, and **non-medical costs** (e.g., lodging), highlighting **financial hardship** and **catastrophic health spending**. For example, a low-income patient accessing subsidized cancer screening may still face travel costs to urban clinics, deterring participation. This perspective ensures **equity**, identifying barriers to access. Conversely, the **societal perspective** captures **all costs and benefits**, including **direct medical costs** (e.g., screening costs), **indirect costs** (e.g., productivity losses), and **intangible costs** (e.g., reduced anxiety). It’s data-intensive but ideal for **macro-level policy decisions**, assessing **Peka B40**’s broader impact on Malaysia’s health system and economy.

**Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)** is the most suitable evaluation type, using **QALYs** to capture **quantity** and **quality of life**. For **Peka B40**, **CUA** evaluates screenings (e.g., for diabetes) by measuring **QALYs gained** (e.g., improved health from early detection), aligning with **MaHTAS** **HTA** requirements. For instance, a screening program costing RM 10 million and generating 5,000 QALYs yields an **ICER** of RM 2,000/QALY, well below Malaysia’s threshold (e.g., RM 50,000/QALY), indicating cost-effectiveness. **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**, using **natural units** like **cases detected**, is less suitable unless quality of life is irrelevant, which is rare for **Peka B40**’s preventive focus. **Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)** applies only for identical outcomes (e.g., bioequivalent drugs), while **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)** monetizes outcomes, raising ethical concerns for health programs.

**Economic principles** like **scarcity** and **opportunity cost** are central. **Scarcity** forces prioritization, as Malaysia’s budget cannot fund all health needs. The **opportunity cost** of expanding **Peka B40** screenings might be forgoing hospital upgrades, requiring evaluation to ensure **value for money**. **Efficiency** (technical and allocative) ensures subsidies maximize health gains, while **marginal analysis** assesses the **incremental cost** of additional screenings (e.g., RM 1,000 per extra QALY). A **CUA** from a **societal perspective** might show **Peka B40** reduces long-term costs (e.g., fewer hospitalizations), justifying investment.

**Policy Recommendations**:

1. **Expand Peka B40 Coverage**: Use **CUA** to prioritize high-impact screenings (e.g., diabetes, cancer), targeting rural and low-income groups to enhance **equity**.
2. **Reduce Patient Barriers**: Subsidize **travel costs** and provide mobile clinics to lower **OOP costs**, informed by **patient perspective** evaluations.
3. **Integrate with MaHTAS**: Use **CUA** results to align **Peka B40** with **HTA** standards, ensuring **sustainability**.

Provide **policy recommendations** for balancing **acute care** and **preventive care**, with insights for global health systems.

**Answer**:  
**Scarcity**, defined as _resources (money, staff, time, technology) are limited, but health needs are unlimited_, is the driving force behind **economic evaluation** in Malaysia’s health system. With finite budgets and rising demands from non-communicable diseases (e.g., diabetes) and aging populations, **prioritization** is essential. **Economic evaluation**—a _comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of costs and consequences_—ensures **value for money**, guiding **efficient** and **equitable** resource allocation. Examples like **Vaccination Programmes** and **MaHTAS** HTA processes illustrate how **full economic evaluations** and **marginal analysis** address **scarcity**, balancing **acute care** (e.g., hospital beds) and **preventive care** (e.g., screenings).

**Vaccination Programmes**, such as Malaysia’s **HPV vaccination** initiative, face **scarcity** due to limited funds and healthcare workers. A **full economic evaluation**, comparing alternatives (e.g., HPV vaccine vs. no intervention), assesses **costs** (e.g., RM 10 million for 100,000 doses) and **consequences** (e.g., 1,000 cervical cancer cases prevented). A **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)** using **QALYs** (e.g., 2,000 QALYs gained, ICER = RM 5,000/QALY) is ideal, as it captures **quality of life**, aligning with **MaHTAS** **HTA** standards. Unlike **partial evaluations**, which lack comparators, **full evaluations** provide a **robust basis** for deciding whether to adopt or scale programs, ensuring **efficiency**.

**MaHTAS** uses **full evaluations** to evaluate new drugs for the **MyHEALTH** formulary. For example, a new diabetes drug (RM 20,000/patient, 5 life years) vs. standard care (RM 12,000, 4 life years) yields an **ICER** of RM 8,000/life year via **CEA**, below Malaysia’s threshold (RM 30,000/life year), justifying adoption. **Marginal analysis** examines **incremental costs** and **benefits**, such as the cost of vaccinating 1,000 more people (e.g., RM 100,000 for 50 QALYs, ICER = RM 2,000/QALY). This fine-tunes decisions, ensuring **optimal resource use**.

**Opportunity cost** highlights trade-offs: funding **acute care** (e.g., hospital beds) may forgo **preventive care** (e.g., screenings), impacting long-term health. **Scarcity** forces choices, and **efficiency** (technical and allocative) ensures **maximum health gains per Ringgit**. For instance, **technical efficiency** uses generic drugs, while **allocative efficiency** prioritizes vaccinations over rare-disease treatments.

**Policy Recommendations**:

1. **Prioritize Preventive Care**: Use **CUA** to scale **Vaccination Programmes**, reducing future disease burden (e.g., HPV, dengue).
2. **Integrate Marginal Analysis**: Assess **incremental benefits** of expanding programs (e.g., additional screenings) to optimize budgets.
3. **Enhance MaHTAS HTA**: Mandate **full evaluations** for all formulary decisions, ensuring **transparency**.
4. **Balance Acute and Preventive Care**: Allocate funds to both (e.g., 60% acute, 40% preventive) based on **ICER** comparisons, supporting **UHC** **equity**.

Globally, these strategies apply to health systems like the UK’s NHS, where **CUA** and **marginal analysis** prioritize cost-effective interventions, ensuring **sustainability** in resource-constrained settings 🌍.
