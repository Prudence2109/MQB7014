Below, I have created a set of **calculation-based self-assessment questions** covering **HE 1 through HE 12** of the **MQB7014: Health Economics** module from the Master of Public Health (MPH) programme at the University of Malaya. These questions are designed to assess **quantitative applications** relevant to health economics, incorporating concepts such as **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**, **discounting**, **costing**, **budget impact**, and **Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)** thresholds, with a focus on Malaysia’s healthcare system (e.g., 2021 THE: RM 78.2 billion, 5.1% GDP; OOP: 31.5% of THE; 2023 hospitalization data: 2.6M public, 1.3M private). Where applicable, questions include instructions for **graph drawing** (e.g., cost-effectiveness plane, tornado diagram) to visualize results. Following the questions, I provide a **complete answer guide** for each, including formulas, calculations, graph plotting instructions, and detailed explanations, ensuring alignment with the lecture content and Malaysia’s context.

### Complete Answer Guide for Calculation-based Questions

Below is a detailed answer guide for each question, including **formulas**, **calculations**, **graph plotting instructions**, and **explanations**, with cross-references to relevant lectures (HE 1–HE 12) and Malaysia’s healthcare context.

#### Question 1: ICER Calculation for a New Cancer Drug (HE 9, HE 10, HE 12)

**Task**:  
a. Calculate the **ICER** in RM per QALY.  
b. Determine if the new therapy is cost-effective based on the WTP threshold of RM 100,000 per QALY.  
c. Plot a **cost-effectiveness plane** to visualize the ICER, labeling the axes, quadrants, and the intervention’s position.

**Answer**:

**a. Calculate the ICER**  
- **Data**:  
  - New targeted therapy: Cost = RM 120,000, QALYs = 2.8  
  - Standard care: Cost = RM 50,000, QALYs = 2.0  
- **Formula**:  
  $$\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{new}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{new}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{comparator}}}$$  
- **Calculation**:  
  - Incremental cost = RM 120,000 - RM 50,000 = RM 70,000  
  - Incremental QALYs = 2.8 - 2.0 = 0.8 QALYs  
  - $$\text{ICER} = \frac{70,000}{0.8} = 87,500 \, \text{RM per QALY}$$

**b. Cost-Effectiveness Determination**  
- **WTP Threshold**: RM 100,000 per QALY (HE 12, Section 4).  
- **Comparison**: The ICER of RM 87,500 per QALY is **below** the WTP threshold, indicating that the new therapy is **cost-effective** for Malaysia’s health system, such as for **MaHTAS** evaluations (HE 12, Section 4; HE 9, Section 3). However, **budget impact** and **equity** must also be considered, as a low ICER does not guarantee affordability or equitable access, especially given Malaysia’s high OOP reliance (31.5% of THE, HE 4, Section 9) (HE 12, Section 6). For instance, high out-of-pocket costs could limit access for low-income patients, aligning with **HE 6**’s focus on addressing **health inequities** (HE 6, Section 2).

**c. Plotting the Cost-Effectiveness Plane**  
- **Description**: The cost-effectiveness plane visualizes the incremental cost (y-axis) versus incremental effectiveness (x-axis), with quadrants indicating different cost-effectiveness scenarios (HE 10, Section 10; HE 12, Section 3).  
- **Axes**:  
  - X-axis: Incremental QALYs (Effectiveness), ranging from -1 to 1 QALYs.  
  - Y-axis: Incremental Costs (RM), ranging from -100,000 to 100,000.  
  - Origin (0,0): Represents the comparator (standard care).  
- **Quadrants**:  
  - **Quadrant I (NE)**: Higher cost, higher effectiveness (where the new therapy lies).  
  - **Quadrant II (NW)**: Lower cost, higher effectiveness (dominant).  
  - **Quadrant III (SW)**: Lower cost, lower effectiveness.  
  - **Quadrant IV (SE)**: Higher cost, lower effectiveness (dominated).  
- **Position**: Plot a point at (0.8 QALYs, RM 70,000) in Quadrant I, representing the new therapy’s incremental QALYs and costs.  
- **Instructions for Plotting**:  
  1. Draw a Cartesian plane with the x-axis labeled “Incremental QALYs” and the y-axis labeled “Incremental Costs (RM).”  
  2. Mark the origin (0,0) as the comparator (standard care).  
  3. Divide the plane into four quadrants, labeling them (NE, NW, SW, SE).  
  4. Plot the point (0.8, 70,000) in Quadrant I, labeling it “New Therapy.”  
  5. Add a dashed line representing the WTP threshold (slope = RM 100,000 per QALY, e.g., y = 100,000x) to show the cost-effectiveness boundary.  
  6. Indicate that the point lies below the threshold line, confirming cost-effectiveness.  
- **Explanation**: The point in Quadrant I shows that the new therapy is more costly and more effective than standard care (HE 10, Section 7). Its position below the WTP threshold line confirms cost-effectiveness, supporting its potential inclusion in Malaysia’s **MyHEALTH formulary**, though **budget impact** (e.g., scaling to a large population) and **equity** (e.g., access for rural patients) must be assessed (HE 12, Sections 6, 9; HE 6, Section 2).

#### Question 2: Discounting Future Costs for a Vaccination Program (HE 10)

**Task**:  
a. Calculate the **present value** of the cost (RM 150,000 in year 5) at a 3% discount rate, rounded to two decimal places.  
b. Explain how discounting impacts the cost-effectiveness analysis for long-term preventive interventions.  
c. Create a **line graph** showing the discounted cost over years 1–5 at a 3% discount rate.

**Answer**:

**a. Calculate the Present Value**  
- **Data**: Future Value (FV) = RM 150,000, Year (n) = 5, Discount Rate (r) = 3% (0.03).  
- **Formula**:  
  $$\text{Present Value} = \frac{\text{Future Value}}{(1 + r)^n}$$  
- **Calculation**:  
  - $$\text{PV} = \frac{150,000}{(1 + 0.03)^5} = \frac{150,000}{(1.03)^5}$$  
  - $$(1.03)^5 = 1.03 \times 1.03 \times 1.03 \times 1.03 \times 1.03 \approx 1.159274$$  
  - $$\text{PV} = \frac{150,000}{1.159274} \approx 129,398.66$$  
  - **Present Value**: RM 129,398.66 (rounded to two decimal places).

**b. Impact of Discounting on Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**  
- **Explanation**: Discounting adjusts future costs and outcomes to their present value, reflecting **time preference** where immediate costs/benefits are valued more than future ones (HE 10, Section 6). For long-term preventive interventions like HPV vaccination, discounting reduces the present value of future costs (e.g., RM 150,000 to RM 129,398.66) and benefits (e.g., QALYs gained from prevented cancers), impacting the **ICER** (HE 10, Section 7). This ensures fair comparisons with immediate-cost interventions, as seen in Malaysia’s **MaHTAS** evaluations, where a 3% discount rate is standard (HE 10, Section 6). However, high discounting can undervalue long-term preventive benefits, potentially biasing against programs like vaccinations that address **health inequities** (e.g., cervical cancer in rural women, HE 6, Section 2). Policymakers must balance this with **budget impact** and **equity** considerations to support **UHC** goals (HE 12, Section 6; HE 5, Section 9).

**c. Plotting the Line Graph**  
- **Description**: The line graph shows the discounted cost of RM 150,000 over years 1–5 at a 3% discount rate, illustrating how present value decreases over time (HE 10, Section 6).  
- **Calculations for Years 1–5**:  
  - Year 1: $$\text{PV} = \frac{150,000}{(1.03)^1} \approx 145,631.07$$  
  - Year 2: $$\text{PV} = \frac{150,000}{(1.03)^2} \approx 141,389.39$$  
  - Year 3: $$\text{PV} = \frac{150,000}{(1.03)^3} \approx 137,271.25$$  
  - Year 4: $$\text{PV} = \frac{150,000}{(1.03)^4} \approx 133,272.86$$  
  - Year 5: $$\text{PV} = \frac{150,000}{(1.03)^5} \approx 129,398.66$$  
- **Axes**:  
  - X-axis: Time (Years 0–5).  
  - Y-axis: Present Value (RM, ranging from 120,000 to 150,000).  
- **Instructions for Plotting**:  
  1. Draw a line graph with the x-axis labeled “Time (Years)” (0 to 5) and the y-axis labeled “Present Value (RM)” (120,000 to 150,000).  
  2. Plot points: (0, 150,000), (1, 145,631.07), (2, 141,389.39), (3, 137,271.25), (4, 133,272.86), (5, 129,398.66).  
  3. Connect the points with a smooth line to show the decline in present value over time.  
  4. Label the graph “Discounted Cost of HPV Vaccination Program (3% Discount Rate).”  
- **Explanation**: The downward trend illustrates the effect of discounting, where future costs lose value over time, critical for long-term interventions like vaccinations (HE 10, Section 6). This visualization helps policymakers understand the reduced present value of future costs, supporting **MaHTAS** evaluations and **UHC** planning (HE 12, Section 10).

#### Question 3: Budget Impact Analysis for Diabetes Screening (HE 12)

**Task**:  
a. Calculate the **total budget impact** of the screening program.  
b. Calculate the **total cost** of treating complications without screening.  
c. Determine the **net budget impact** (savings or additional cost) of implementing the screening program.  
d. Plot a **bar graph** comparing the total costs of screening vs. treatment, labeling costs and scenarios.

**Answer**:

**a. Total Budget Impact of Screening Program**  
- **Data**: Cost per person = RM 200, Target Population = 1.5 million adults.  
- **Calculation**:  
  - Total Budget Impact = Cost per person × Population  
  - $$200 \times 1,500,000 = 300,000,000$$  
  - **Total Budget Impact**: RM 300,000,000.

**b. Total Cost of Treating Complications Without Screening**  
- **Data**: Cost per case = RM 5,000, Expected cases = 2,000.  
- **Calculation**:  
  - Total Cost = Cost per case × Number of cases  
  - $$5,000 \times 2,000 = 10,000,000$$  
  - **Total Cost**: RM 10,000,000.

**c. Net Budget Impact**  
- **Calculation**:  
  - Net Budget Impact = Total Budget Impact (Screening) - Total Cost (Treatment)  
  - $$300,000,000 - 10,000,000 = 290,000,000$$  
  - **Net Budget Impact**: Additional cost of RM 290,000,000.  
- **Explanation**: The screening program incurs an additional cost of RM 290 million compared to treating complications without screening, reflecting a significant **budget impact** despite its cost-effective ICER (RM 95,000 per QALY, below Malaysia’s WTP threshold of RM 100,000, HE 12, Section 6). This aligns with **HE 12**’s emphasis on balancing **cost-effectiveness** with **affordability** and **fiscal space** (HE 12, Section 6). The high cost could strain Malaysia’s public health budget (2021 THE: RM 78.2 billion, HE 4, Section 9), requiring consideration of **equity** (e.g., targeting high-risk rural populations, HE 6, Section 2) and **feasibility** (e.g., IT infrastructure needs, HE 12, Section 5).

**d. Plotting the Bar Graph**  
- **Description**: The bar graph compares the total costs of the screening program (RM 300 million) and treatment without screening (RM 10 million), highlighting the budget impact (HE 12, Section 6).  
- **Axes**:  
  - X-axis: Scenarios (“Screening Program,” “Treatment Without Screening”).  
  - Y-axis: Total Cost (RM, ranging from 0 to 350,000,000).  
- **Instructions for Plotting**:  
  1. Draw a bar graph with the x-axis labeled “Scenarios” and the y-axis labeled “Total Cost (RM).”  
  2. Create two bars:  
     - “Screening Program” at RM 300,000,000.  
     - “Treatment Without Screening” at RM 10,000,000.  
  3. Label each bar with its cost value (e.g., “RM 300M,” “RM 10M”).  
  4. Title the graph “Budget Impact: Diabetes Screening vs. Treatment Without Screening.”  
- **Explanation**: The bar graph visually emphasizes the significant cost difference, with screening being 30 times more expensive than treatment alone, highlighting the **budget impact** challenge (HE 12, Section 6). This visualization aids policymakers in assessing **fiscal space** and prioritizing interventions, aligning with **MaHTAS** evaluations and **UHC** goals (HE 12, Section 10; HE 5, Section 9).

#### Question 4: Sensitivity Analysis for a Hypertension Drug (HE 10, HE 11)

**Task**:  
a. Calculate the **percentage change** in the ICER for each cost variation (±20% of RM 60,000).  
b. Determine if the drug remains cost-effective across the cost range, given a WTP threshold of RM 100,000 per QALY.  
c. Create a **tornado diagram** to visualize the impact of drug cost variation on the ICER, labeling the base case and range.

**Answer**:

**a. Calculate the Percentage Change in ICER**  
- **Data**:  
  - Base-case ICER = RM 80,000 per QALY, Base cost = RM 60,000.  
  - Cost variation: ±20% (RM 48,000–RM 72,000).  
  - Resulting ICERs: RM 64,000 (at RM 48,000), RM 96,000 (at RM 72,000).  
- **Formula**:  
  $$\text{\% Change} = \frac{\text{New ICER} - \text{Original ICER}}{\text{Original ICER}} \times 100\%$$  
- **Calculation for Lower Cost (RM 48,000)**:  
  - New ICER = RM 64,000, Original ICER = RM 80,000  
  - $$\text{\% Change} = \frac{64,000 - 80,000}{80,000} \times 100\% = \frac{-16,000}{80,000} \times 100\% = -20\%$$  
- **Calculation for Higher Cost (RM 72,000)**:  
  - New ICER = RM 96,000, Original ICER = RM 80,000  
  - $$\text{\% Change} = \frac{96,000 - 80,000}{80,000} \times 100\% = \frac{16,000}{80,000} \times 100\% = +20\%$$  
- **Results**:  
  - Lower cost: -20% change (ICER decreases to RM 64,000).  
  - Higher cost: +20% change (ICER increases to RM 96,000).

**b. Cost-Effectiveness Across the Cost Range**  
- **WTP Threshold**: RM 100,000 per QALY (HE 12, Section 4).  
- **Comparison**:  
  - Base-case ICER (RM 80,000) is **cost-effective** (< RM 100,000).  
  - Lower cost ICER (RM 64,000) is **cost-effective** and more favorable.  
  - Higher cost ICER (RM 96,000) is **cost-effective**, as it remains below the threshold.  
- **Explanation**: The drug remains cost-effective across the cost range (RM 48,000–RM 72,000), as all ICERs are below RM 100,000 per QALY, supporting its potential inclusion in Malaysia’s **Peka B40** program (HE 12, Section 10; HE 11, Section 10). However, **sensitivity analysis** ensures robustness, as highlighted in **HE 10** (Section 8) and **HE 11**’s CHEERS requirement for clear uncertainty reporting (HE 11, Section 6). Policymakers must also consider **equity** (e.g., access for low-income patients, HE 6, Section 2) and **budget impact** (HE 12, Section 6).

**c. Plotting the Tornado Diagram**  
- **Description**: A tornado diagram visualizes the impact of drug cost variation on the ICER, showing the range of ICERs relative to the base case (HE 10, Section 8; HE 11, Section 6).  
- **Data**:  
  - Base-case ICER: RM 80,000.  
  - Cost variation: RM 48,000 (ICER = RM 64,000), RM 72,000 (ICER = RM 96,000).  
- **Axes**:  
  - X-axis: ICER (RM per QALY, ranging from 60,000 to 100,000).  
  - Y-axis: Parameter (“Drug Cost”).  
- **Instructions for Plotting**:  
  1. Draw a horizontal bar graph with the x-axis labeled “ICER (RM per QALY)” (60,000 to 100,000) and the y-axis labeled “Parameter.”  
  2. Plot a single horizontal bar for “Drug Cost,” extending from RM 64,000 (left) to RM 96,000 (right).  
  3. Mark the base-case ICER (RM 80,000) with a vertical line through the bar.  
  4. Label the bar ends with RM 48,000 (ICER = 64,000) and RM 72,000 (ICER = 96,000).  
  5. Add a dashed vertical line at RM 100,000 to indicate the WTP threshold.  
  6. Title the graph “Tornado Diagram: Sensitivity of ICER to Drug Cost Variation.”  
- **Explanation**: The tornado diagram shows that drug cost variation significantly impacts the ICER, with a 20% cost decrease lowering the ICER by 20% and a 20% increase raising it by 20%, yet all values remain cost-effective (HE 10, Section 8). This visualization, per **HE 11**’s CHEERS item 20, ensures **transparency** in uncertainty reporting, aiding **MaHTAS** decisions (HE 11, Section 6; HE 12, Section 10).

#### Question 5: DRG Costing for Hospital Admissions (HE 12)

**Task**:  
a. Verify the **base rate** using the provided formula.  
b. Calculate the **cost per case** for Appendectomy and Stroke DRGs.  
c. Plot a **bar graph** comparing the costs of the two DRG groups, labeling the groups and costs.

**Answer**:

**a. Verify the Base Rate**  
- **Data**: Hospital Pool (HP_t) = RM 40,000,000, Cases (Cases_h,t-1) = 10,000, Base Rate (BR_t) = RM 4,000.  
- **Formula**:  
  $$\text{BR}_t = \frac{\text{HP}_t}{\text{Cases}_{h,t-1}}$$  
- **Calculation**:  
  - $$\text{BR}_t = \frac{40,000,000}{10,000} = 4,000$$  
  - **Verification**: The base rate of RM 4,000 is correct, as it matches the provided value, aligning with **HE 12**’s DRG costing methodology (HE 12, Section 7).

**b. Calculate Cost per Case for Appendectomy and Stroke DRGs**  
- **Data**: Base Rate = RM 4,000, Appendectomy Cost Weight = 0.85, Stroke Cost Weight = 1.7.  
- **Formula**: Cost per Case = Base Rate × Cost Weight  
- **Calculation for Appendectomy**:  
  - $$4,000 \times 0.85 = 3,400$$  
  - **Cost per Case**: RM 3,400.  
- **Calculation for Stroke**:  
  - $$4,000 \times 1.7 = 6,800$$  
  - **Cost per Case**: RM 6,800.  
- **Explanation**: The Stroke DRG is more costly due to its higher resource intensity (cost weight = 1.7 vs. 0.85), reflecting **HE 12**’s emphasis on DRG’s ability to standardize costs for clinically similar groups (HE 12, Section 7). This supports Malaysia’s **casemix system** for hospital budgeting and **MaHTAS** evaluations, though **IT infrastructure** challenges limit full implementation (HE 12, Section 7).

**c. Plotting the Bar Graph**  
- **Description**: The bar graph compares the costs of Appendectomy (RM 3,400) and Stroke (RM 6,800) DRGs, illustrating resource intensity differences (HE 12, Section 7).  
- **Axes**:  
  - X-axis: DRG Groups (“Appendectomy,” “Stroke”).  
  - Y-axis: Cost per Case (RM, ranging from 0 to 8,000).  
- **Instructions for Plotting**:  
  1. Draw a bar graph with the x-axis labeled “DRG Groups” and the y-axis labeled “Cost per Case (RM).”  
  2. Create two bars:  
     - “Appendectomy” at RM 3,400.  
     - “Stroke” at RM 6,800.  
  3. Label each bar with its cost value (e.g., “RM 3,400,” “RM 6,800”).  
  4. Title the graph “DRG Cost Comparison: Appendectomy vs. Stroke.”  
- **Explanation**: The bar graph highlights the higher cost of Stroke due to greater resource use, supporting **DRG’s scalability** for hospital financing (HE 12, Section 7). This visualization aids **MaHTAS** in budgeting and aligns with **HE 4**’s focus on transparent financing (HE 4, Section 9).


#### Question 6: Supply and Demand for Influenza Vaccines (HE 1, HE 2, HE 6, HE 7)

**Explanation**:  
This question draws on **HE 2**’s concepts of **supply and demand** and **price elasticity** (Section 3), **HE 1**’s discussion of **market failures** (e.g., under-consumption of preventive care, Section 2), **HE 6**’s focus on **equity** and **social determinants** (Section 2), and **HE 7**’s emphasis on **government interventions** like subsidies and price controls (Section 2). The tasks require students to visualize market dynamics through graphs, calculate changes in demand, and analyze policy impacts, aligning with Malaysia’s **UHC** goals to improve access for vulnerable groups like the elderly. The **price ceiling** analysis tests understanding of market distortions and equity implications, critical for Malaysia’s high OOP context (31.5% of THE, HE 4, Section 9).

**Answer**:

**a. Draw and Label Initial Supply and Demand Curves (5 marks)**  
- **Description**: The initial supply and demand curves represent the market for quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV) without intervention, with an equilibrium price of RM 150 and quantity of 250,000 doses (HE 2, Section 3).  
- **Axes**:  
  - X-axis: Quantity (doses, ranging from 0 to 800,000).  
  - Y-axis: Price (RM, ranging from 0 to 200).  
- **Instructions for Plotting**:  
  1. Draw a Cartesian plane with the x-axis labeled “Quantity (Doses)” and the y-axis labeled “Price (RM).”  
  2. Plot the **demand curve (D1)** as a downward-sloping line, intersecting the **supply curve (S)** at the equilibrium point (250,000 doses, RM 150).  
  3. Plot the **supply curve (S)** as an upward-sloping line, starting from a low quantity at a low price (e.g., 50,000 doses at RM 50) to a high quantity at a high price (e.g., 600,000 doses at RM 200).  
  4. Mark the equilibrium point at (250,000, 150) and label it “E1.”  
  5. Label the curves “D1” (initial demand) and “S” (supply), and title the graph “Initial Market for QIV.”  
- **Explanation**: The equilibrium at (250,000, RM 150) reflects the market without intervention, where supply equals demand (HE 2, Section 3). This indicates under-consumption of vaccines, a **market failure** due to **externalities** (e.g., herd immunity benefits not captured, HE 1, Section 2), particularly affecting low-income elderly who cannot afford RM 150 doses.

**b. Draw and Label New Curves After Full Subsidy (5 marks)**  
- **Description**: A full subsidy reduces the price to RM 0, shifting the demand curve rightward to a new equilibrium quantity of 700,000 doses, with the supply curve unchanged (HE 2, Section 3; HE 7, Section 2).  
- **Axes**: Same as part (a): X-axis (Quantity, 0 to 800,000), Y-axis (Price, 0 to 200).  
- **Instructions for Plotting**:  
  1. Use the same Cartesian plane from part (a), retaining the original supply curve (S).  
  2. Plot a new **demand curve (D2)**, shifted rightward, intersecting the supply curve at (700,000 doses, RM 0).  
  3. Mark the new equilibrium point at (700,000, 0) and label it “E2.”  
  4. Label the new demand curve “D2” (post-subsidy demand), and update the title to “Market for QIV with Full Subsidy.”  
  5. Indicate the shift from D1 to D2 with an arrow to show increased demand due to the subsidy.  
- **Explanation**: The subsidy eliminates the price barrier, increasing demand from 250,000 to 700,000 doses, reflecting a rightward demand curve shift (HE 2, Section 3). This aligns with **HE 7**’s government intervention to address **market failures** by promoting preventive care access, supporting **UHC** goals (HE 7, Section 6).

**c. Calculate Change in Quantity Demanded and Impact on Private Providers (5 marks)**  
- **Calculation**:  
  - Initial quantity demanded: 250,000 doses (at RM 150).  
  - New quantity demanded: 700,000 doses (at RM 0 with subsidy).  
  - Change in quantity demanded = 700,000 - 250,000 = **450,000 doses**.  
- **Impact on Private Providers**:  
  - **Explanation**: Without the subsidy, private providers sell 250,000 doses at RM 150, generating revenue of RM 150 × 250,000 = RM 37,500,000 (HE 2, Section 3). With a full subsidy, the MOH covers the cost, increasing demand to 700,000 doses, potentially supplied by private providers at a negotiated price (e.g., RM 150, costing MOH RM 150 × 700,000 = RM 105,000,000). However, private providers selling at RM 150 without subsidy face reduced demand, as patients opt for subsidized doses, leading to revenue loss (HE 7, Section 2). This may push providers to participate in the MOH program or exit the market, impacting supply dynamics (HE 3, Section 5). The subsidy enhances **equity** by improving access for low-income elderly, aligning with **HE 6**’s focus on reducing **health inequities** (HE 6, Section 2).

**d. Analyze Price Ceiling Effects on Supply, Demand, and Elderly Access (10 marks)**  
- **Analysis**:  
  - **Price Ceiling (RM 70)**: Setting a price ceiling below the equilibrium price (RM 150) creates a market distortion (HE 2, Section 3; HE 7, Section 2).  
  - **Effect on Supply**: At RM 70, suppliers are less willing to provide vaccines due to lower profitability, reducing supply (e.g., to ~100,000 doses, assuming a supply curve point). This leads to a **shortage**, as quantity supplied is less than quantity demanded (HE 2, Section 3).  
  - **Effect on Demand**: At RM 70, demand increases (e.g., to ~400,000 doses, assuming a demand curve point), as the lower price makes vaccines more affordable, but the shortage limits actual purchases (HE 2, Section 3).  
  - **Effect on Elderly Access**: The price ceiling improves affordability for low-income elderly, aligning with **equity** goals (HE 6, Section 2), but the shortage restricts access, particularly for those without public sector access, exacerbating **health inequities** (HE 6, Section 9). Rural elderly face additional barriers due to **social determinants** like distance to providers (HE 6, Section 2).  
  - **Policy Implications**: The shortage may lead to black markets or long queues, undermining **UHC** (HE 7, Section 6). A better approach is a targeted subsidy via **Peka B40**, ensuring access without distorting supply (HE 4, Section 9; HE 5, Section 9).  
- **Explanation**: The price ceiling, while intended to enhance **equity**, creates a **market failure** by reducing supply, limiting vaccine availability (HE 1, Section 2). This contradicts **UHC** goals, as shortages disproportionately affect low-income elderly reliant on private providers (HE 6, Section 2). Malaysia’s high OOP reliance (31.5% of THE, HE 4, Section 9) underscores the need for subsidies over price controls to ensure equitable access without market distortions (HE 7, Section 2).

**Graph for Part (d) - Optional Visualization for Analysis**:  
- **Description**: To illustrate the price ceiling’s effects, a graph can show the supply and demand curves with the ceiling at RM 70.  
- **Instructions**:  
  1. Use the initial graph from part (a).  
  2. Draw a horizontal line at RM 70, labeled “Price Ceiling.”  
  3. Mark the quantity demanded (~400,000 doses) and quantity supplied (~100,000 doses) at RM 70, indicating the shortage (difference between demand and supply).  
  4. Label the shortage area and title the graph “Price Ceiling Effects on QIV Market.”  
- **Explanation**: The graph highlights the shortage caused by the price ceiling, reinforcing the analysis of reduced supply and limited access (HE 2, Section 3).
