### Structured Case Study Questions (HE 1‚ÄìHE 12)

These questions require students to analyze complex scenarios, providing **critical analysis** and **policy recommendations** based on health economics principles from **HE 1‚ÄìHE 12**. Each case includes **sub-questions** to structure responses, testing **conceptual understanding**, **application**, and **synthesis**.

#### Case Study 1: Evaluating a New Hepatitis C Drug for Malaysia‚Äôs Public Health System (HE 9, HE 10, HE 11, HE 12)
**Scenario**: Malaysia‚Äôs Ministry of Health (MOH) is considering adopting a new Hepatitis C drug for its public health system. The drug costs RM 80,000 per patient annually, yielding 3.0 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), compared to standard care at RM 30,000 per patient annually, yielding 2.2 QALYs. The target population is 50,000 patients. The study reporting these results omits details on the discount rate and utility valuation method but includes a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Malaysia‚Äôs Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) threshold is RM 100,000 per QALY, and the MOH budget is constrained.

- **Sub-Questions**:  
  a. Calculate the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** and determine if the drug is cost-effective.  
  b. Appraise the study‚Äôs reporting quality using the **CHEERS 2022 checklist** for items 8 (Perspective), 10 (Discount Rate), and 13 (Valuation of Outcomes), using the coding system (‚úÖ, üü°, ‚ùå).  
  c. Discuss how the reporting gaps affect the study‚Äôs **policy relevance** for **MaHTAS**.  
  d. Recommend whether **MaHTAS** should adopt the drug, considering **budget impact**, **equity**, and **feasibility**, and propose how to address reporting gaps.

#### Case Study 2: Prioritizing Cervical Cancer Screening Programs in Rural Malaysia (HE 6, HE 10, HE 12)
**Scenario**: The MOH is evaluating two cervical cancer screening programs for rural Malaysian women: **Program A (HPV Self-Sampling)** costs RM 100 per person, yields 0.05 QALYs, and targets 500,000 women annually; **Program B (Clinic-Based Pap Smear)** costs RM 150 per person, yields 0.06 QALYs, and targets 300,000 women. Both use a health system perspective, a 5-year horizon, and a 3% discount rate. Malaysia‚Äôs WTP threshold is RM 120,000 per QALY. Rural areas face access challenges, and equity is a priority.

- **Sub-Questions**:  
  a. Calculate the **ICER** for each program compared to no screening (0 QALYs, RM 0 cost) and determine cost-effectiveness.  
  b. Apply **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)** to compare the programs, scoring **cost-effectiveness**, **equity**, and **feasibility** (use ‚úÖ Strong, ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate, ‚ùå Weak).  
  c. Discuss how **social determinants of health** (e.g., rural access) influence the decision.  
  d. Recommend which program to fund, justifying with **MCDA** and **equity** considerations, and propose implementation strategies.

#### Case Study 3: Financing a National Diabetes Management Program (HE 4, HE 5, HE 10, HE 12)
**Scenario**: Malaysia is designing a national diabetes management program to reduce complications, funded through **Social Health Insurance (SHI)** or **Out-of-Pocket (OOP)** payments. The program costs RM 200 million annually, targeting 1 million patients, with an ICER of RM 90,000 per QALY (health system perspective, 10-year horizon, 3% discount rate). Without the program, complications cost RM 50 million annually. Malaysia‚Äôs WTP threshold is RM 100,000 per QALY, but high OOP reliance (31.5% of THE) raises equity concerns.

- **Sub-Questions**:  
  a. Calculate the **net budget impact** of the program compared to treating complications.  
  b. Evaluate the impact of **SHI** vs. **OOP financing** on **equity** and **financial protection**.  
  c. Discuss how **market failures** (e.g., moral hazard, provider-induced demand) might affect program costs.  
  d. Recommend a financing strategy, justifying with **equity**, **budget impact**, and **UHC** goals.

### Complete Answer Guide for Structured Case Study Questions

Below is a detailed answer guide for each case study question, including **calculations**, **analyses**, **policy recommendations**, and cross-references to **HE 1‚ÄìHE 12**, with a focus on Malaysia‚Äôs healthcare context and **UHC** goals.

#### Case Study 1: Evaluating a New Hepatitis C Drug for Malaysia‚Äôs Public Health System (HE 9, HE 10, HE 11, HE 12)

**Sub-Questions**:  
a. Calculate the **ICER** and determine if the drug is cost-effective.  
b. Appraise the study‚Äôs reporting quality using **CHEERS 2022** for items 8, 10, and 13.  
c. Discuss how reporting gaps affect **policy relevance** for **MaHTAS**.  
d. Recommend whether **MaHTAS** should adopt the drug, addressing reporting gaps.

**Answer**:

**a. Calculate the ICER and Determine Cost-Effectiveness**  
- **Data**:  
  - New drug: Cost = RM 80,000, QALYs = 3.0  
  - Standard care: Cost = RM 30,000, QALYs = 2.2  
  - WTP threshold: RM 100,000 per QALY (HE 12, Section 4).  
- **Formula**:  
  $$\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{new}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{new}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{comparator}}}$$  
- **Calculation**:  
  - Incremental cost = RM 80,000 - RM 30,000 = RM 50,000  
  - Incremental QALYs = 3.0 - 2.2 = 0.8 QALYs  
  - $$\text{ICER} = \frac{50,000}{0.8} = 62,500 \, \text{RM per QALY}$$  
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: The ICER of RM 62,500 per QALY is **below** the WTP threshold of RM 100,000, indicating the drug is **cost-effective** (HE 9, Section 4; HE 10, Section 7; HE 12, Section 4).  

**b. Appraise Reporting Quality Using CHEERS 2022**  
- **CHEERS Items and Coding (HE 11, Section 6)**:  
  - **Item 8: Perspective**: ‚úÖ Clearly reported (health system perspective, assumed based on MOH context).  
  - **Item 10: Discount Rate**: ‚ùå Not reported (study omits discount rate details).  
  - **Item 13: Valuation of Outcomes**: üü° Mentioned but incomplete (QALYs reported, but utility valuation method, e.g., EQ-5D, is not specified).  
- **Explanation**: The study clearly states the health system perspective, aligning with **MaHTAS** requirements (HE 11, Section 6). However, omitting the discount rate undermines transparency, as stakeholders cannot verify how future costs/QALYs were adjusted (HE 10, Section 6). Incomplete utility valuation details reduce QALY credibility, as per **CHEERS 2022** requirements (HE 11, Section 9).

**c. Impact of Reporting Gaps on Policy Relevance for MaHTAS**  
- **Discussion**: The missing discount rate (Item 10) and incomplete utility valuation (Item 13) reduce the study‚Äôs **policy relevance** for **MaHTAS**, as they hinder **reproducibility** and **trust** (HE 11, Sections 3, 9). Without a discount rate, policymakers cannot assess whether future costs/QALYs align with Malaysia‚Äôs 3% standard, potentially overvaluing benefits (HE 10, Section 6). Incomplete utility details obscure QALY validity, critical for **CUA** in **HTA** (HE 9, Section 4). These gaps, per **HE 11**‚Äôs CHEERS checklist, limit **MaHTAS**‚Äôs ability to make evidence-based decisions, especially given Malaysia‚Äôs budget constraints (2021 THE: RM 78.2 billion, HE 4, Section 9). The gaps also raise **equity** concerns, as unclear QALYs may not reflect benefits for low-income patients, aligning with **HE 6**‚Äôs focus on addressing **health inequities** (HE 6, Section 2).

**d. Policy Recommendation and Addressing Reporting Gaps**  
- **Recommendation**: **MaHTAS** should **conditionally adopt** the Hepatitis C drug, given its cost-effective ICER (RM 62,500 < RM 100,000), but require a revised study with improved reporting to confirm findings (HE 12, Section 10). The **budget impact** (RM 80,000 √ó 50,000 = RM 4 billion annually) is significant, straining fiscal space, so phased implementation targeting high-risk groups (e.g., rural patients) is advised to enhance **equity** (HE 12, Section 6; HE 6, Section 2). **Feasibility** requires assessing drug supply chains and clinician training (HE 12, Section 5).  
- **Addressing Gaps**: Request authors to:  
  1. Specify the **discount rate** (e.g., 3%, per MaHTAS norms, HE 10, Section 6) to ensure transparency (CHEERS Item 10, HE 11, Section 6).  
  2. Detail **utility valuation** methods (e.g., EQ-5D with Malaysian tariffs) to validate QALYs (CHEERS Item 13, HE 11, Section 6).  
  3. Conduct additional **sensitivity analyses** on cost and utility parameters to enhance robustness (HE 10, Section 8).  
- **Justification**: Conditional adoption balances **cost-effectiveness** with **budget constraints** and **equity**, aligning with **UHC** goals (HE 5, Section 9; HE 12, Section 10). Improved reporting ensures **MaHTAS** can trust the findings, supporting **evidence-based policy** (HE 11, Section 10).

#### Case Study 2: Prioritizing Cervical Cancer Screening Programs in Rural Malaysia (HE 6, HE 10, HE 12)

**Sub-Questions**:  
a. Calculate the **ICER** for each program compared to no screening and determine cost-effectiveness.  
b. Apply **MCDA** to compare programs, scoring **cost-effectiveness**, **equity**, and **feasibility**.  
c. Discuss how **social determinants** influence the decision.  
d. Recommend which program to fund, with implementation strategies.

**Answer**:

**a. Calculate ICER and Determine Cost-Effectiveness**  
- **Data**:  
  - Program A (HPV Self-Sampling): Cost = RM 100 per person, QALYs = 0.05, Population = 500,000.  
  - Program B (Clinic-Based Pap Smear): Cost = RM 150 per person, QALYs = 0.06, Population = 300,000.  
  - No screening: Cost = RM 0, QALYs = 0.  
  - WTP threshold: RM 120,000 per QALY (HE 12, Section 4).  
- **Formula**:  
  $$\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{new}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{new}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{comparator}}}$$  
- **Calculation for Program A**:  
  - Incremental cost = RM 100 - RM 0 = RM 100  
  - Incremental QALYs = 0.05 - 0 = 0.05  
  - $$\text{ICER} = \frac{100}{0.05} = 2,000 \, \text{RM per QALY}$$  
- **Calculation for Program B**:  
  - Incremental cost = RM 150 - RM 0 = RM 150  
  - Incremental QALYs = 0.06 - 0 = 0.06  
  - $$\text{ICER} = \frac{150}{0.06} = 2,500 \, \text{RM per QALY}$$  
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Both programs are **highly cost-effective**, as their ICERs (RM 2,000 and RM 2,500 per QALY) are far below the WTP threshold of RM 120,000 (HE 9, Section 4; HE 10, Section 7; HE 12, Section 4).  

**b. Apply MCDA to Compare Programs**  
- **MCDA Scoring (HE 12, Section 10)**:  
  | **Criterion** | **Program A (HPV)** | **Program B (Pap Smear)** |  
  |--------------|--------------------|-------------------------|  
  | **Cost-Effectiveness** | ‚úÖ Strong (ICER = RM 2,000) | ‚úÖ Strong (ICER = RM 2,500) |  
  | **Equity** | ‚úÖ Strong (self-sampling improves rural access) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate (clinic-based, limited by access) |  
  | **Feasibility** | ‚úÖ Strong (mobile deployment feasible) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate (requires clinic infrastructure) |  
  | **Total Score** | High | Moderate |  
- **Explanation**: Both programs are cost-effective, but Program A scores higher in **equity** due to self-sampling‚Äôs accessibility in rural areas, addressing **Inverse Care Law** issues (HE 6, Section 2). Program A‚Äôs **feasibility** is stronger, as mobile deployment requires less infrastructure than clinic expansion (HE 12, Section 5). Program B‚Äôs higher ICER and reliance on clinics reduce its equity and feasibility (HE 10, Section 10).

**c. Influence of Social Determinants**  
- **Discussion**: **Social determinants of health** (e.g., rural access, poverty, education) significantly influence the decision (HE 6, Section 9). Rural Malaysian women face barriers like distance to clinics and low health literacy, exacerbating **health inequities** (e.g., higher cervical cancer rates, HE 6, Section 2). Program A‚Äôs self-sampling approach mitigates these by enabling home-based testing, improving access and equity, while Program B‚Äôs clinic requirement limits reach, aligning with **HE 6**‚Äôs **Inverse Care Law** (HE 6, Section 2). **HE 10**‚Äôs emphasis on context-specific outcomes (e.g., QALYs reflecting rural needs) supports Program A‚Äôs relevance for **UHC** goals (HE 10, Section 5; HE 5, Section 9).

**d. Recommendation and Implementation Strategies**  
- **Recommendation**: Fund **Program A (HPV Self-Sampling)** due to its **high MCDA score**, **strong equity benefits**, and **feasibility** (HE 12, Section 10). Its ICER (RM 2,000) is highly cost-effective, and its budget impact (RM 100 √ó 500,000 = RM 50 million) is manageable compared to Program B (RM 150 √ó 300,000 = RM 45 million), especially given Program A‚Äôs larger reach (HE 12, Section 6).  
- **Implementation Strategies**:  
  1. Deploy **mobile health units** to distribute self-sampling kits, addressing rural access barriers (HE 6, Section 9).  
  2. Partner with **community health workers** to educate women, improving uptake and addressing low health literacy (HE 6, Section 2).  
  3. Use **DRG/case-mix costing** to standardize screening costs for budgeting, leveraging Malaysia‚Äôs UNU-CBG Grouper (HE 12, Section 7).  
  4. Integrate with **Peka B40** to subsidize costs, reducing OOP burdens (31.5% of THE, HE 4, Section 9).  
- **Justification**: Program A aligns with **UHC** and **equity** goals, addressing rural disparities and ensuring cost-effective, scalable screening (HE 5, Section 9; HE 12, Section 10).

#### Case Study 3: Financing a National Diabetes Management Program (HE 4, HE 5, HE 10, HE 12)

**Sub-Questions**:  
a. Calculate the **net budget impact** of the program compared to treating complications.  
b. Evaluate **SHI** vs. **OOP financing** on **equity** and **financial protection**.  
c. Discuss how **market failures** affect program costs.  
d. Recommend a financing strategy, justifying with **equity**, **budget impact**, and **UHC** goals.

**Answer**:

**a. Calculate Net Budget Impact**  
- **Data**:  
  - Program cost: RM 200 million annually, 1 million patients.  
  - Complication treatment cost: RM 50 million annually.  
- **Calculation**:  
  - Net Budget Impact = Program Cost - Complication Cost  
  - $$200,000,000 - 50,000,000 = 150,000,000$$  
  - **Net Budget Impact**: Additional cost of RM 150,000,000.  
- **Explanation**: The program incurs an additional RM 150 million compared to treating complications, reflecting a significant **budget impact** despite its cost-effective ICER (RM 90,000 < RM 100,000, HE 12, Section 6). This aligns with **HE 12**‚Äôs emphasis on assessing **fiscal space** (HE 12, Section 6).

**b. Evaluate SHI vs. OOP Financing**  
- **SHI**:  
  - **Equity**: Enhances equity by spreading costs across a mandatory risk pool, reducing financial barriers for low-income patients (HE 5, Section 5).  
  - **Financial Protection**: Protects against catastrophic health expenditures, critical given Malaysia‚Äôs 31.5% OOP reliance (HE 4, Section 9).  
- **OOP**:  
  - **Equity**: Exacerbates inequities, as low-income patients face financial burdens, worsening access disparities (HE 6, Section 2).  
  - **Financial Protection**: Increases risk of financial hardship, undermining **UHC** goals (HE 5, Section 9).  
- **Explanation**: **SHI** aligns with **HE 5**‚Äôs focus on **risk pooling** for equitable access, while **OOP** contradicts **HE 6**‚Äôs emphasis on reducing **health inequities** (HE 5, Section 5; HE 6, Section 2).

**c. Impact of Market Failures**  
- **Discussion**: **Market failures** like **moral hazard** and **provider-induced demand** can inflate program costs (HE 3, Section 5; HE 7, Section 2). **Moral hazard** may lead to overuse of subsidized services (e.g., unnecessary tests) under SHI, increasing costs (HE 5, Section 5). **Provider-induced demand** could result in over-prescription of treatments by private providers, especially in Malaysia‚Äôs dual system (HE 3, Section 5). These align with **HE 7**‚Äôs call for government regulation (e.g., **separation of prescribing and dispensing**) to mitigate cost escalation (HE 7, Section 2). Robust **costing** (e.g., DRG, HE 12, Section 7) and **sensitivity analysis** (HE 10, Section 8) are needed to account for these risks.

**d. Financing Strategy Recommendation**  
- **Recommendation**: Adopt **SHI** financing for the diabetes program to enhance **equity** and **financial protection**, aligning with **UHC** goals (HE 5, Section 9; HE 12, Section 10). The **net budget impact** (RM 150 million) is significant but justifiable given the cost-effective ICER (RM 90,000), which supports **MaHTAS** adoption (HE 12, Section 4).  
- **Implementation Strategies**:  
  1. Implement **SHI** through mandatory contributions, leveraging **risk pooling** to spread costs (HE 5, Section 5).  
  2. Use **DRG/case-mix costing** to standardize program costs, ensuring scalability (HE 12, Section 7).  
  3. Introduce **gatekeeping** to mitigate **moral hazard** and **provider-induced demand** (HE 5, Section 8; HE 7, Section 2).  
  4. Target **high-risk groups** (e.g., rural, low-income) to address **equity**, integrating with **Peka B40** (HE 6, Section 2).  
- **Justification**: **SHI** reduces OOP burdens, addressing Malaysia‚Äôs high OOP reliance (HE 4, Section 9) and promoting **equity** (HE 6, Section 2). The program‚Äôs cost-effectiveness supports **UHC**, while regulatory measures ensure cost control (HE 12, Section 10).
