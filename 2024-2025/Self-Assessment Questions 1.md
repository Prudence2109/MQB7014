# Answer Guide for Calculation-Based Questions

## Question 1: Supply and Demand for Influenza Vaccines

**Context**: The Malaysian Ministry of Health (MOH) is planning a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) program for 600,000 elderly (‚â•60 years). Without intervention, the market price is RM 150 per dose, with an equilibrium quantity of 250,000 doses. A full subsidy reduces the price to RM 0, increasing demand to 700,000 doses. A price ceiling of RM 70 is proposed.

### Tasks and Model Answers

#### a) Draw and Label Initial Supply and Demand Curves (5 marks)

**Task**: Draw and label the initial supply and demand curves, marking the equilibrium price (RM 150) and quantity (250,000 doses).

**Answer**:

- **Equilibrium Concept**: The **equilibrium point** occurs where **supply equals demand**, determining the market price and quantity (**HE 2**, Section 3). ![[Pasted image 20250707134200.png]]
- **Graph Description**:
    - **Axes**: Vertical axis = Price (RM), Horizontal axis = Quantity (doses).
    - **Demand Curve**: Downward sloping, reflecting that lower prices increase quantity demanded.
    - **Supply Curve**: Upward sloping, as higher prices incentivize more supply.
    - **Equilibrium**: Marked at Price = RM 150, Quantity = 250,000 doses, where curves intersect.
- **Diagram** (in exam, sketch by hand):
    - Draw a downward-sloping demand curve (D1) and an upward-sloping supply curve (S).
    - Label the intersection as E1 (P = RM 150, Q = 250,000).

**Marking Notes**: Full marks for accurate axes, labeled curves, and correct equilibrium point.

#### b) Draw and Label New Curves After Subsidy (5 marks)

**Task**: Draw and label the new curves after the full subsidy, showing the demand shift and new equilibrium quantity (700,000 doses). Assume the supply curve is unchanged.

**Answer**:

- **Subsidy Impact**: A **full subsidy** (price = RM 0) increases affordability, shifting the **demand curve rightward** due to higher quantity demanded (**HE 7**, Section 2). ![[Pasted image 20250707134235.png]]
- **Graph Description**:
    - **Original Curves**: Retain supply curve (S) and initial demand curve (D1).
    - **New Demand Curve**: Shift demand to D2, reflecting increased demand at zero cost.
    - **New Equilibrium**: Intersection of S and D2 at P = RM 0, Q = 700,000 doses (E2).
- **Diagram**:
    - Draw S (unchanged), D1, and new D2 (shifted right).
    - Label E2 at Q = 700,000, P = RM 0.

**Marking Notes**: Full marks for correct demand shift, new equilibrium, and labeled curves.

#### c) Calculate Change in Quantity Demanded and Explain Private Provider Impact (5 marks)

**Task**: Calculate the **change in quantity demanded** due to the subsidy and explain its impact on private providers selling at RM 150.

**Answer**:

- **Calculation**:
    - Initial quantity demanded: 250,000 doses.
    - New quantity demanded: 700,000 doses.
    - Change in quantity demanded:  
        $$700,000 - 250,000 = 450,000 \text{ doses}$$
- **Explanation**:
    - **Increased Demand**: The subsidy reduces the price to RM 0, increasing demand by **450,000 doses**, reflecting higher uptake among the elderly (**HE 2**, Section 3).
    - **Private Providers**: At RM 150, private providers face **reduced sales**, as free public vaccines attract most consumers. This may lead to **lower profits** or **market exit** for private suppliers, impacting their viability (**HE 7**, Section 6).

**Marking Notes**: Full marks for correct calculation (2 marks) and clear explanation of private provider impact (3 marks).

#### d) Analyze Price Ceiling Effects and Equity (10 marks)

**Task**: Analyze the **price ceiling** (RM 70) effects on supply, demand, and elderly access, considering **equity** for low-income groups.

**Answer**:

- **Price Ceiling Concept**: A **price ceiling** of RM 70 caps the vaccine price below the equilibrium (RM 150), aiming to improve affordability (**HE 7**, Section 2).
- **Effects**:
    - **Demand**: Increases due to lower price, shifting quantity demanded beyond 250,000 doses.
    - **Supply**: Decreases, as suppliers are less incentivized at RM 70, potentially causing a **shortage** (quantity supplied < quantity demanded).
    - **Access**: Improved for low-income elderly due to lower costs, but shortages may limit availability, especially in rural areas with weaker supply chains (**HE 6**, Section 2).
- **Equity Implications**:
    - **Positive**: Low-income elderly benefit from affordable vaccines, reducing financial barriers (OOP: 31.5% of THE, **HE 4**, Section 9).
    - **Negative**: Shortages may disproportionately affect rural elderly, exacerbating **Inverse Care Law** (care less available where most needed, **HE 6**, Section 3).
- **Conclusion**: The price ceiling enhances **equity** by lowering costs but risks **access issues** due to shortages, requiring supply-side interventions (e.g., subsidies to producers).

**Marking Notes**: Full marks for analyzing supply/demand effects (5 marks) and equity implications (5 marks).

**Table: Summary of Price Ceiling Effects**

|**Aspect**|**Effect**|**Equity Impact**|
|---|---|---|
|Demand|Increases due to lower price|Improves affordability for low-income|
|Supply|Decreases, causing shortages|Risks reduced access in rural areas|
|Access|Improved but limited by supply|Mixed: helps cost but not availability|

## Question 2: ICER and Discounting for QIV Program

**Context**: A study reports a QIV program for 500,000 elderly costs RM 60,000,000 annually, yielding 12,000 QALYs, versus no vaccination (RM 50,000,000 hospitalization costs, 0 QALYs). Malaysia‚Äôs WTP threshold is RM 120,000/QALY, with a 3% discount rate.

### Tasks and Model Answers

#### a) Calculate ICER Without Discounting (5 marks)

**Task**: Calculate the **ICER** for QIV versus no vaccination, assuming no discounting.

**Answer**:

- **Formula**:  
    $$\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{new}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{comparator}}}{\text{Effect}_{\text{new}} - \text{Effect}_{\text{comparator}}}$$
- **Data**:
    - QIV: Cost = RM 60,000,000, Effect = 12,000 QALYs.
    - No vaccination: Cost = RM 50,000,000, Effect = 0 QALYs.
- **Calculation**:
    - Incremental Cost:  
        $$60,000,000 - 50,000,000 = 10,000,000 \text{ RM}$$
    - Incremental Effect:  
        $$12,000 - 0 = 12,000 \text{ QALYs}$$
    - ICER:  
        $$\text{ICER} = \frac{10,000,000}{12,000} = 833.33 \text{ RM per QALY}$$
- **Result**: The **ICER** is **833.33 RM/QALY** (**HE 9**, Section 4).

**Marking Notes**: Full marks for correct formula, data, and calculation.

#### b) Apply 3% Discount Rate and Recalculate ICER (10 marks)

**Task**: Apply a **3% discount rate** to QIV costs and QALYs (year 5 benefits), using:  
$$\text{Present Value} = \frac{\text{Future Value}}{(1 + r)^n}$$  
Recalculate the ICER.

**Answer**:

- **Formula**:  
    $$\text{PV} = \frac{\text{FV}}{(1 + 0.03)^5}$$
- **Discounting Costs**:
    - QIV Cost: RM 60,000,000 in year 5.
    - Discount factor:  
        $$(1 + 0.03)^5 = 1.159274$$  
        $$\text{PV}_{\text{cost}} = \frac{60,000,000}{1.159274} = 51,747,598 \text{ RM}$$
    - No vaccination cost (assumed immediate): RM 50,000,000 (undiscounted).
    - Incremental Cost:  
        $$51,747,598 - 50,000,000 = 1,747,598 \text{ RM}$$
- **Discounting QALYs**:
    - QIV QALYs: 12,000 in year 5.
    - Discount factor: 1.159274.
    - Discounted QALYs:  
        $$\text{PV}_{\text{QALYs}} = \frac{12,000}{1.159274} = 10,349.44 \text{ QALYs}$$
    - No vaccination: 0 QALYs.
    - Incremental Effect:  
        $$10,349.44 - 0 = 10,349.44 \text{ QALYs}$$
- **ICER Calculation**:  
    $$\text{ICER} = \frac{1,747,598}{10,349.44} = 168.87 \text{ RM per QALY}$$
- **Result**: The **discounted ICER** is **168.87 RM/QALY** (**HE 10**, Section 6).

**Marking Notes**: Full marks for correct discounting (5 marks) and ICER recalculation (5 marks).

#### c) Interpret Cost-Effectiveness with WTP Threshold (5 marks)

**Task**: Interpret the QIV‚Äôs cost-effectiveness using the discounted ICER and WTP threshold.

**Answer**:

- **Comparison**: The **discounted ICER** (168.87 RM/QALY) is significantly below Malaysia‚Äôs **WTP threshold** of **120,000 RM/QALY** (**HE 12**, Section 4).
- **Interpretation**: The QIV is **highly cost-effective**, as its cost per QALY gained is minimal compared to the threshold, justifying funding for the elderly.
- **Policy Implication**: The low ICER supports inclusion in **Peka B40** or **UHC** programs, reducing hospitalization costs (USD 4.4 million savings, **HE 12**, Section 5).

**Marking Notes**: Full marks for clear comparison and policy link.

#### d) Discuss Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (5 marks)

**Task**: Discuss how **probabilistic sensitivity analysis** strengthens the ICER‚Äôs reliability for MOH decisions.

**Answer**:

- **Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA)**: Tests **uncertainty** by assigning probability distributions to parameters (e.g., costs, QALYs) and running simulations (e.g., Monte Carlo) to estimate ICER variability (**HE 10**, Section 8).
- **Strengthens Reliability**:
    - **Robustness**: PSA shows the likelihood that the ICER remains below RM 120,000/QALY across scenarios, increasing MOH confidence.
    - **Key Drivers**: Identifies parameters (e.g., vaccine cost) impacting ICER, guiding data collection.
    - **Policy Relevance**: Provides **cost-effectiveness acceptability curves**, helping MOH assess risks in funding decisions.
- **Example**: Varying QIV costs by ¬±20% in PSA ensures the ICER‚Äôs stability, supporting **MaHTAS** evaluations (**HE 12**, Section 11).

**Marking Notes**: Full marks for explaining PSA and its policy relevance.

**Table: ICER Summary**

|**Scenario**|**Incremental Cost (RM)**|**Incremental QALYs**|**ICER (RM/QALY)**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Undiscounted|10,000,000|12,000|833.33|
|Discounted|1,747,598|10,349.44|168.87|

## Question 3: DRG Costing for Influenza Treatment

**Context**: A hospital uses MY-DRG Casemix data to estimate influenza treatment costs: mild (RM 2,500), moderate (RM 6,800), severe (RM 13,500). It treats 1,200 cases (55% mild, 35% moderate, 10% severe). Base rate: RM 2,000.

### Tasks and Model Answers

#### a) Calculate Total Cost Using DRG-Based Costing (8 marks)

**Task**: Calculate the **total cost** using **DRG-based costing**, deriving cost weights from given costs and base rate.

**Answer**:

- **Formula**:  
    $$\text{Total Cost} = \sum (\text{Cost Weight}_i \times \text{Base Rate} \times \text{Number of Cases}_i)$$  
    where Cost Weight = Cost / Base Rate (**HE 12**, Section 7).
- **Cost Weights**:
    - Mild:  
        $$\text{Cost Weight}_{\text{mild}} = \frac{2,500}{2,000} = 1.25$$
    - Moderate:  
        $$\text{Cost Weight}_{\text{moderate}} = \frac{6,800}{2,000} = 3.4$$
    - Severe:  
        $$\text{Cost Weight}_{\text{severe}} = \frac{13,500}{2,000} = 6.75$$
- **Case Distribution**:
    - Mild: 55% of 1,200 = $0.55 \times 1,200 = 660$ cases.
    - Moderate: 35% of 1,200 = $0.35 \times 1,200 = 420$ cases.
    - Severe: 10% of 1,200 = $0.10 \times 1,200 = 120$ cases.
- **Cost Calculation**:
    - Mild: $660 \times 1.25 \times 2,000 = 1,650,000 \text{ RM}$.
    - Moderate: $420 \times 3.4 \times 2,000 = 2,856,000 \text{ RM}$.
    - Severe: $120 \times 6.75 \times 2,000 = 1,620,000 \text{ RM}$.
    - Total Cost:  
        $$1,650,000 + 2,856,000 + 1,620,000 = 6,126,000 \text{ RM}$$
- **Result**: The **total cost** is **RM 6,126,000**.

**Marking Notes**: Full marks for correct weights (3 marks), case distribution (2 marks), and total cost (3 marks).

#### b) Estimate Costs Using Micro-Costing (5 marks)

**Task**: Estimate costs using **micro-costing**, assuming a 10% increase for precision.

**Answer**:

- **Micro-Costing**: Itemizes all resources, increasing precision but not using DRG weights (**HE 12**, Section 7).
- **Calculation**:
    - DRG Costs: Mild = RM 2,500, Moderate = RM 6,800, Severe = RM 13,500.
    - Micro-Costing Costs (10% increase):
        - Mild: $2,500 \times 1.1 = 2,750 \text{ RM}$.
        - Moderate: $6,800 \times 1.1 = 7,480 \text{ RM}$.
        - Severe: $13,500 \times 1.1 = 14,850 \text{ RM}$.
    - Total Cost:  
        $$(660 \times 2,750) + (420 \times 7,480) + (120 \times 14,850) = 1,815,000 + 3,141,600 + 1,782,000 = 6,738,600 \text{ RM}$$
- **Result**: The **micro-costing total** is **RM 6,738,600**.
