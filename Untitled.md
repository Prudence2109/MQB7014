### üî¢ Calculation-based Questions
*To test quantitative application of economic principles, focusing on scarcity, opportunity costs, and marginal analysis.*

1. **Budget Allocation for Health Programs**  
   A Malaysian public hospital has a budget of RM 100,000 to allocate between two programs: **vaccination** (costing RM 50 per dose, benefiting 500 people per 1,000 doses) and **diabetes screening** (costing RM 200 per screening, benefiting 200 people per 1,000 screenings).  
   - Calculate the **opportunity cost** of allocating RM 50,000 to vaccinations in terms of foregone diabetes screenings.  
   - If the hospital increases vaccination funding by RM 10,000 (from RM 50,000 to RM 60,000), how many additional people are benefited, and what is the **marginal benefit** per RM 1,000 spent?  
   - \[ \text{Opportunity Cost} = \frac{\text{Budget Allocated to Vaccinations}}{\text{Cost per Screening}} \]  
   - \[ \text{Marginal Benefit} = \frac{\text{Additional People Benefited}}{\text{Additional Budget (in thousands)}} \]

2. **Marginal Analysis for Hospital Staffing**  
   A clinic in Malaysia hires additional nurses at RM 3,000 per month each. The table below shows the number of patients served daily as nurses are added:  

   | Nurses | Patients Served Daily |
   |--------|-----------------------|
   | 1      | 20                    |
   | 2      | 35                    |
   | 3      | 45                    |
   | 4      | 50                    |
   | 5      | 52                    |

   - Calculate the **marginal benefit** (additional patients served) of hiring each additional nurse.  
   - Using **marginal analysis**, determine the optimal number of nurses if the clinic values each additional patient served at RM 200.  
   - Explain how the **law of diminishing returns** applies to this scenario.

3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis for Equipment Investment**  
   A Malaysian health ministry considers purchasing an MRI machine for RM 2,000,000, expected to serve 1,000 patients annually, reducing treatment costs by RM 500 per patient. Maintenance costs are RM 100,000 annually.  
   - Calculate the **net benefit** of the investment in the first year using the **cost-benefit principle** (\[ \text{Net Benefit} = (\text{Benefit per Patient} \times \text{Patients Served}) - (\text{Cost} + \text{Maintenance}) \]).  
   - If the machine‚Äôs efficiency decreases by 10% annually (serving 10% fewer patients each year), at what year does the **net benefit** become negative?  
   - Discuss how **opportunity costs** influence this decision if the budget could fund 50,000 vaccinations at RM 40 each.

Discuss one **trade-off** the Ministry of Health faces when prioritizing hospital funding over preventive care, and propose a solution to balance these priorities. ü©∫

2. **Asymmetry of Information in Patient Care**  
   Describe how **asymmetry of information** between doctors and patients impacts health care decision-making in Malaysia. Provide an example of a scenario where this leads to suboptimal care, and suggest a policy to mitigate this issue. ü§î

3. **Externalities and Public Health**  
   Discuss how **externalities** in health care, such as herd immunity, justify government intervention in Malaysia. Explain one public health program (e.g., vaccination campaign) that leverages **positive externalities**, and evaluate its economic impact. üåç

4. **Rational Decision-Making in Health Policy**  
   Using the **rational person** concept, explain how a Malaysian hospital administrator might decide whether to invest in a new dialysis unit. Discuss how **cost-benefit analysis** and **opportunity costs** influence this decision, referencing Malaysia‚Äôs hospitalization data (2.6M public, 1.3M private in 2023). üè•

5. **Law of Diminishing Returns in Resource Allocation**  
   Apply the **law of diminishing returns** to a scenario where a Malaysian clinic increases its budget for diagnostic equipment. Explain how additional spending might yield **diminishing returns**, and propose a strategy to optimize resource use. üìâ

### ü©∫ Structured Case Study Questions
*To analyze complex scenarios, providing critical analysis and policy recommendations with sub-questions to structure responses.*

1. **Case Study: Resource Allocation in a Malaysian Public Hospital**  
   A public hospital in Kuala Lumpur, funded by Malaysia‚Äôs **2022 health expenditure** (RM 78,945M), faces a budget constraint of RM 10M for the next year. The hospital must decide between expanding **emergency services** (cost: RM 6M, benefiting 5,000 patients annually) or **community outreach programs** (cost: RM 4M, benefiting 10,000 people through preventive care). The hospital serves 100,000 patients annually, with **externalities** from outreach (e.g., reduced disease spread) impacting the community.  
   - **Conceptual Understanding**: Define **scarcity** and **opportunity costs**, and explain how they apply to this hospital‚Äôs decision.  
   - **Analysis**: Using the **cost-benefit principle**, compare the benefits and costs of each option, considering **externalities** (e.g., herd immunity from outreach).  
   - **Policy Recommendation**: Propose a funding allocation strategy, justifying your choice with **marginal analysis** and referencing Malaysia‚Äôs **public health priorities**.  
   - **Synthesis**: Discuss how **asymmetry of information** between hospital staff and patients might influence the implementation of your strategy, and suggest a mitigation approach.  

2. **Case Study: Private Clinic Monopolies in Rural Malaysia**  
   A rural town in Sabah relies on a single private clinic, creating a **provider monopoly**. The clinic charges high fees, limiting access for low-income families (reflecting Malaysia‚Äôs **4M private outpatient visits** in 2023). The state government considers subsidies or public clinic expansion to improve **equity**.  
   - **Conceptual Understanding**: Explain **provider monopolies** and their impact on **patient choice** and **health care costs**.  
   - **Analysis**: Analyze how the **monopoly** contributes to **inequity** in access, using the concept of **human right** to health.  
   - **Policy Recommendation**: Recommend a policy (e.g., subsidies, new public clinic) to address the **monopoly**, incorporating **cost-benefit analysis** and **externalities** (e.g., community health benefits).  
   - **Synthesis**: Discuss how **scarcity** and **opportunity costs** shape the feasibility of your policy in Sabah‚Äôs resource-constrained context, referencing Malaysia‚Äôs **health expenditure** data.
