### 🔍 Key Points from the Lecture 📋

The lecture is structured into 11 sections, each addressing critical aspects of **economic evaluation**:

- **Introduction to Economic Evaluation**: Introduces **economic evaluation** as a **comparative**, **systematic** tool to assess **value for money**, guiding **resource allocation** in Malaysia’s health system to address **scarcity** and support **UHC** goals 🩺.
- **Challenge of Scarcity in Healthcare**: Highlights **scarcity** as the driver of **trade-offs**, where **limited resources** force **prioritization** (e.g., funding **cancer screening** vs. **ICU beds**). Traditional **gut feelings** are inadequate, necessitating **rational frameworks** like economic evaluation 🌍.
- **Defining Economic Evaluation**: Defines it as a **comparative analysis** of **costs** and **consequences**, answering _“Is the added benefit worth the additional cost?”_ It supports **efficient allocation**, prioritizing **high-value interventions** (e.g., comparing treatments costing RM 10,000 vs. RM 14,000 for 3 vs. 4 life years) 💰.
- **Understanding Costs and Consequences**: Outlines **costs** (direct medical, non-medical, indirect, intangible) and **consequences** (clinical, preference-weighted, economic), which must be **identified**, **measured**, and **valued** based on **perspective** 📈.
- **Relevance to Health Systems**: Emphasizes economic evaluation’s role in addressing **limited budgets** and **rising demand**, ensuring **transparency**, **accountability**, and **fair resource use** in Malaysia’s **HTA** (via **MaHTAS**), **formulary listing** (**MyHEALTH**, **MyHD**), and **UHC** initiatives 🌐.
- **Types of Economic Evaluation**: Details four types—**CMA** (same outcomes, cost-focused), **CEA** (natural units, e.g., life years), **CUA** (QALYs/DALYs), and **CBA** (monetary outcomes)—each suited to specific contexts, with **CUA** preferred for **HTA** in Malaysia 📊.
- **Partial vs. Full Economic Evaluation**: Contrasts **partial evaluations** (single intervention, no comparator) with **full evaluations** (comparing alternatives), noting that **full evaluations** provide a **robust basis** for decision-making ⚖️.
- **Core Economic Concepts**: Explores **opportunity cost** (trade-offs), **scarcity** (limited resources), **efficiency** (technical and allocative), and **marginal analysis** (incremental cost-benefit via **ICER**), underpinning **value-driven** decisions 🧠.
- **Perspective in Economic Evaluation**: Defines **perspective** as determining **whose costs** and **benefits** are included (societal, health system, payer, patient), with examples like **breast cancer therapy** yielding different conclusions per perspective 👁️.
- **Timing and Situations for Economic Evaluation**: Identifies when to conduct evaluations (e.g., new interventions, scaling programs, budget allocation) and when to avoid them (e.g., uncertain outcomes), emphasizing alignment with **planning cycles** ⏰.
- **Key Takeaways**: Summarizes economic evaluation as a tool for **wise decisions** in **scarcity**, supporting **equity**, **efficiency**, and **sustainability** in Malaysia’s health system and beyond 🌟.

### 📖 Key Terminologies Introduced 🧠

The lecture introduces several **key terminologies** critical to understanding **economic evaluation**:

- **Economic Evaluation**: _A comparative analysis of alternative courses of action in terms of both their costs and consequences_ (Drummond et al., 2005). It assesses **value for money** to guide resource allocation 💰.
- **Scarcity**: _Resources (money, staff, time, technology) are limited, but health needs are unlimited_, necessitating **prioritization** and **trade-offs** 🌍.
- **Opportunity Cost**: _The value of the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made_, highlighting trade-offs (e.g., funding **vaccinations** vs. **ICU beds**) 💸.
- **Costs**: _The value of resources used in an intervention_, including:
    - **Direct Medical Costs**: Expenses like **hospital stays**, **medications**, **staff time** 🩺.
    - **Direct Non-Medical Costs**: Costs like **transport**, **caregiving** 🚗.
    - **Indirect Costs**: **Productivity losses** due to illness or treatment 💼.
    - **Intangible Costs**: Non-monetized costs like **pain**, **anxiety** 😟.
- **Consequences**: _The outcomes or effects of an intervention_, including:
    - **Clinical**: Outcomes like **infections prevented**, **life years gained** 📈.
    - **Preference-Weighted**: Metrics like **QALYs** (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) or **DALYs** (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) ⚖️.
    - **Economic**: **Monetized outcomes** in **CBA** 💵.
- **Value for Money**: The balance of **costs** and **health benefits**, ensuring resources deliver maximum impact 📊.
- **Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)**: Compares costs when outcomes are identical, choosing the cheapest option (e.g., bioequivalent drugs) 💰.
- **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA)**: Measures outcomes in **natural units** (e.g., life years), using the **ICER** (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio, $\text{ICER} = \frac{\Delta \text{Cost}}{\Delta \text{Effectiveness}}$) to assess cost per outcome (e.g., RM 50,000/life year) 📈.
- **Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA)**: Uses **QALYs** or **DALYs** to capture **quantity** and **quality of life**, common in **HTA** (e.g., RM 100,000/QALY) ⚖️.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA)**: Converts outcomes to **monetary value**, comparing benefits to costs (e.g., workplace health ROI) 💵.
- **Partial Evaluation**: A **cost-outcome study** of a single intervention without a comparator, limiting **relative value** assessment 🔍.
- **Full Economic Evaluation**: Compares **two or more interventions** for **robust decision-making** (e.g., vaccine vs. standard care) ⚖️.
- **Efficiency**: _Achieving maximum benefit from available resources_, via:
    - **Technical Efficiency**: Lowest cost for a given output (e.g., generic drugs) 💊.
    - **Allocative Efficiency**: Maximizing **population health** (e.g., prioritizing vaccinations) 🌐.
- **Marginal Analysis**: Examines **incremental cost** and **benefit** of small changes, using **ICER** to optimize decisions 🧠.
