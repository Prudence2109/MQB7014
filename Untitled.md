### üî¢ Calculation-based Questions: Applying Quantitative Skills üìä

These questions test quantitative application of **economic evaluation** concepts, particularly the **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**.

#### 1. Calculating ICER for a New Drug

**Question**: A new diabetes drug costs **RM 20,000** per patient and provides **5 life years**, while standard care costs **RM 12,000** and provides **4 life years**. Calculate the **ICER** and interpret if the new drug is cost-effective given Malaysia‚Äôs threshold of **RM 30,000 per life year gained**.

**Answer**:

- **Formula**: The **ICER** is calculated as:  
    $$\text{ICER}=\frac{\Delta\text{Cost}}{\Delta\text{Effectiveness}}$$  
    where $\Delta\text{Cost}$ is the cost difference and $\Delta\text{Effectiveness}$ is the difference in life years.
- **Calculation**:
    - $\Delta\text{Cost}=\text{RM 20,000}-\text{RM 12,000}=\text{RM 8,000}$
    - $\Delta\text{Effectiveness}=5\text{ life years}-4\text{ life years}=1\text{ life year}$
    - $$\text{ICER}=\frac{\text{RM 8,000}}{1\text{ life year}}=\text{RM 8,000 per life year}$$
- **Interpretation**: The **ICER** of **RM 8,000 per life year** is below Malaysia‚Äôs threshold of **RM 30,000 per life year**, indicating the new drug is **cost-effective**. This suggests that the additional cost of **RM 8,000** for an extra life year is a worthwhile investment for Malaysia‚Äôs health system, aligning with **HTA** goals via **MaHTAS**. Policymakers can justify adopting the drug, considering **scarcity** and **efficiency**, as it maximizes **health gains per Ringgit**.

#### 2. Comparing Screening Programs

**Question**: A breast cancer screening program costs **RM 500,000** and detects **50 cases**, while an alternative program costs **RM 600,000** and detects **60 cases**. Calculate the **ICER** and determine if the alternative is cost-effective if Malaysia values a detected case at **RM 15,000**.

**Answer**:

- **Formula**: $$\text{ICER}=\frac{\Delta\text{Cost}}{\Delta\text{Effectiveness}}$$  
    where $\Delta\text{Cost}$ is the cost difference and $\Delta\text{Effectiveness}$ is the difference in cases detected.
- **Calculation**:
    - $\Delta\text{Cost}=\text{RM 600,000}-\text{RM 500,000}=\text{RM 100,000}$
    - $\Delta\text{Effectiveness}=60\text{ cases}-50\text{ cases}=10\text{ cases}$
    - $$\text{ICER}=\frac{\text{RM 100,000}}{10\text{ cases}}=\text{RM 10,000 per case detected}$$
- **Interpretation**: The **ICER** of **RM 10,000 per case detected** is below the threshold of **RM 15,000 per case**, indicating the alternative program is **cost-effective**. This suggests that the additional **RM 100,000** for detecting 10 more cases is a valuable investment for Malaysia‚Äôs health system, supporting **early detection** and **UHC** goals. The **health system perspective** focuses on medical costs, ensuring **efficiency** in resource allocation.

#### 3. Cost-Utility Analysis for a Vaccine

**Question**: A new vaccine costs **RM 1,000,000** and generates **10,000 QALYs**, while the current vaccine costs **RM 800,000** and generates **9,500 QALYs**. Calculate the **ICER** and determine if the new vaccine is cost-effective, assuming a **MaHTAS** threshold of **RM 50,000 per QALY**.

**Answer**:

- **Formula**: $$\text{ICER}=\frac{\Delta\text{Cost}}{\Delta\text{Effectiveness}}$$  
    where $\Delta\text{Cost}$ is the cost difference and $\Delta\text{Effectiveness}$ is the difference in QALYs.
- **Calculation**:
    - $\Delta\text{Cost}=\text{RM 1,000,000}-\text{RM 800,000}=\text{RM 200,000}$
    - $\Delta\text{Effectiveness}=10,000\text{ QALYs}-9,500\text{ QALYs}=500\text{ QALYs}$
    - $$\text{ICER}=\frac{\text{RM 200,000}}{500\text{ QALYs}}=\text{RM 400 per QALY}$$
- **Interpretation**: The **ICER** of **RM 400 per QALY** is well below the **MaHTAS** threshold of **RM 50,000 per QALY**, indicating the new vaccine is **highly cost-effective**. This supports its adoption in Malaysia‚Äôs **Vaccination Programme**, aligning with **UHC** by improving **quality of life**. The **CUA** approach, using **QALYs**, ensures **efficiency** and **equity**, as the vaccine maximizes health gains for a modest cost increase.

#### 4. Budget Impact Analysis

**Question**: A new hypertension treatment costs **RM 5,000 per patient** and is expected to treat **1,000 patients annually**. The current treatment costs **RM 3,000 per patient**. Calculate the **additional annual budget** required and determine if the health system can afford it with a budget increase limit of **RM 1,500,000**.

**Answer**:

- **Formula**: Additional budget = (New cost per patient - Current cost per patient) √ó Number of patients
- **Calculation**:
    - Cost difference per patient = $\text{RM 5,000}-\text{RM 3,000}=\text{RM 2,000}$
    - Additional annual budget = $\text{RM 2,000}\times 1,000\text{ patients}=\text{RM 2,000,000}$
- **Interpretation**: The **additional annual budget** required is **RM 2,000,000**, which exceeds the budget increase limit of **RM 1,500,000**. The health system **cannot afford** the new treatment without reallocating funds or exceeding the budget cap. This highlights **scarcity** and the need for **economic evaluation** to assess **opportunity costs** (e.g., forgoing other programs like **Peka B40**) and ensure **efficiency** in Malaysia‚Äôs health system.

#### 5. Cost-Minimization Analysis for Generic Drugs

**Question**: Two bioequivalent generic drugs for malaria have identical outcomes. Drug A costs **RM 100 per treatment**, and Drug B costs **RM 80 per treatment** for **10,000 treatments annually**. Calculate the **annual cost savings** by choosing Drug B and explain why **CMA** is appropriate.

**Answer**:

- **Formula**: Annual cost savings = (Cost of Drug A - Cost of Drug B) √ó Number of treatments
- **Calculation**:
    - Cost difference per treatment = $\text{RM 100}-\text{RM 80}=\text{RM 20}$
    - Annual cost savings = $\text{RM 20}\times 10,000\text{ treatments}=\text{RM 200,000}$
- **Interpretation**: Choosing Drug B saves **RM 200,000 annually**, enhancing **efficiency** in Malaysia‚Äôs health system. **CMA** is appropriate because the drugs have **proven identical outcomes** (bioequivalence), making **cost differences** the sole decision criterion. This aligns with **MaHTAS** goals for **formulary listing**, ensuring **value for money** by selecting the cheaper option without compromising effectiveness.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Short-Essay Questions: Applying Concepts to Practical Scenarios üìù

These questions require concise responses (200‚Äì300 words) applying **economic evaluation** principles to practical scenarios.

#### 1. Applying Opportunity Cost in Malaysia‚Äôs Health System

**Question**: Explain how **opportunity cost** influences healthcare decisions in Malaysia, using the example of choosing between funding a **new dialysis center** or a **diabetes prevention program**. Discuss the trade-offs and how economic evaluation can guide the decision.

**Answer**: **Opportunity cost**, defined as _the value of the next best alternative forgone when a decision is made_, is central to healthcare decisions in Malaysia‚Äôs resource-constrained system. Choosing to fund a **new dialysis center** (e.g., RM 5 million) may mean forgoing a **diabetes prevention program** (e.g., RM 4 million), as **scarcity** limits resources. The trade-off involves prioritizing **acute care** for kidney patients versus **preventive care** to reduce future diabetes cases. A dialysis center provides immediate **clinical outcomes** (life years gained for 500 patients), but prevention could yield broader **population health benefits** (e.g., 10,000 screenings reducing complications). **Economic evaluation**, such as **CEA**, compares **costs** (infrastructure, staff) and **consequences** (cases prevented, life years gained) to assess **value for money**. Using the **ICER** ($\text{ICER}=\frac{\Delta\text{Cost}}{\Delta\text{Effectiveness}}$), policymakers can determine which option maximizes **health gains per Ringgit**. A **societal perspective** includes **indirect costs** (e.g., productivity losses) and **non-medical costs** (e.g., patient travel), while a **health system perspective** focuses on medical costs. Economic evaluation ensures **transparency** and **efficiency**, guiding Malaysia‚Äôs **UHC** goals by balancing **short-term needs** with **long-term prevention**, ensuring **equitable** resource allocation.

#### 2. Choosing the Right Perspective for Peka B40

**Question**: Discuss why the **patient perspective** is critical when evaluating the **Peka B40** program in Malaysia. Explain how it differs from the **health system perspective** and why both are relevant for **UHC** goals.

**Answer**: The **patient perspective** is critical for evaluating **Peka B40**, a Malaysian program subsidizing healthcare for low-income groups, as it focuses on **out-of-pocket (OOP) costs** (e.g., co-payments), **travel/food/lodging costs**, and **income loss** due to illness or caregiving. This perspective highlights **financial hardship** and **catastrophic health spending**, ensuring **equity** by assessing affordability for vulnerable populations. For example, a rural patient accessing **Peka B40** screenings may incur significant travel costs, which economic evaluation captures to prevent inequitable burdens. In contrast, the **health system perspective** focuses on **direct medical costs** (e.g., staff, equipment) borne by Malaysia‚Äôs public health system, ensuring **efficiency** in budget allocation for programs like **Peka B40**. It excludes **OOP costs** and **productivity losses**, potentially overlooking patient burdens. Both perspectives are relevant for **UHC** goals: the **patient perspective** ensures **equitable access**, aligning with **UHC**‚Äôs focus on protecting vulnerable groups, while the **health system perspective** supports **sustainability** through **MaHTAS** evaluations. **Economic evaluation**, using **CUA** with **QALYs**, can integrate both to balance **cost**, **outcomes**, and **equity**, ensuring **Peka B40** maximizes **health gains** while remaining affordable for patients and the system.

#### 3. When to Conduct Economic Evaluation

**Question**: Describe a scenario where Malaysia‚Äôs **Ministry of Health** should conduct an economic evaluation (e.g., introducing a new vaccine) and one where it should avoid it (e.g., uncertain outcomes). Explain the importance of **timing** and **data quality**.

**Answer**: Malaysia‚Äôs **Ministry of Health** should conduct an **economic evaluation** when introducing a **new vaccine**, such as a dengue vaccine, to assess **value for money**. This scenario involves a **new intervention** with significant costs and potential **clinical outcomes** (e.g., infections prevented). Using **CUA** with **QALYs**, the evaluation compares the vaccine to **no intervention**, calculating the **ICER** ($\text{ICER}=\frac{\Delta\text{Cost}}{\Delta\text{Effectiveness}}$) to ensure **efficiency** for **MaHTAS** approval. **Timing** is critical during **budget planning** to influence **formulary listing**. Conversely, evaluation should be avoided when **outcomes are uncertain**, such as a new drug with limited clinical trial data, as unreliable **effectiveness data** lead to speculative results, wasting resources. **Data quality** is essential: high-quality **effectiveness data** (e.g., proven reduction in dengue cases) ensure **credible** evaluations, while **uncertain data** undermine **transparency**. Aligning evaluations with **planning cycles** maximizes impact, supporting **UHC** by prioritizing **high-impact programs** like **Vaccination Programmes**. **Timing** and **data quality** ensure evaluations are **relevant** and **actionable**, guiding Malaysia‚Äôs health system toward **equitable** and **efficient** resource allocation.

#### 4. Efficiency in Resource Allocation

**Question**: Explain the difference between **technical efficiency** and **allocative efficiency** using Malaysia-specific examples. Discuss how these concepts ensure **value for money** in healthcare.

**Answer**: **Technical efficiency**, defined as _producing a given output at the lowest cost_, focuses on cost minimization for the same outcome. In Malaysia, using **generic drugs** instead of branded ones for hypertension (e.g., RM 50 vs. RM 200 per patient) achieves **technical efficiency** by delivering identical **clinical outcomes** at lower cost, saving resources for **Peka B40**. **Allocative efficiency**, defined as _allocating resources to maximize population health_, prioritizes interventions with the greatest health impact. For example, investing in **HPV vaccination** (preventing cervical cancer) over rare-disease treatments maximizes **population health** for Malaysia‚Äôs **UHC** goals. Both ensure **value for money**: **technical efficiency** reduces costs (e.g., via **CMA** for generics), while **allocative efficiency** directs funds to high-impact programs (e.g., **CUA** for vaccinations). **Economic evaluation**, using **ICER** ($\text{ICER}=\frac{\Delta\text{Cost}}{\Delta\text{Effectiveness}}$), quantifies **health gains per Ringgit**, ensuring **transparency** and **efficiency**. By applying these concepts, Malaysia‚Äôs health system optimizes **scarce resources**, supporting **MaHTAS** evaluations and **equitable** healthcare delivery.

#### 5. Selecting the Appropriate Evaluation Type

**Question**: A new cancer drug is being considered for Malaysia‚Äôs **MyHEALTH** formulary. Discuss whether **CUA** or **CEA** is more appropriate, justifying your choice based on **outcome measures** and **HTA** requirements.

**Answer**: For a new cancer drug considered for Malaysia‚Äôs **MyHEALTH** formulary, **CUA** is more appropriate than **CEA** due to its comprehensive **outcome measure**, **QALYs**, which captures both **quantity** and **quality of life**. Cancer treatments often involve trade-offs (e.g., extended survival but toxic side effects), making **QALYs** ideal for assessing **patient well-being**, a priority in **HTA** via **MaHTAS**. **CUA** calculates **cost per QALY gained** (e.g., RM 100,000/QALY), aligning with **MaHTAS** thresholds for **value for money**. **CEA**, using **natural units** like **life years gained**, is less suitable as it ignores **quality of life**, which is critical for cancer patients. For example, a drug extending life by 1 year but causing severe side effects may have a low **ICER** in **CEA** ($\text{ICER}=\frac{\Delta\text{Cost}}{\Delta\text{Effectiveness}}$) but fail to reflect reduced **QALYs**. **CUA**‚Äôs comprehensive approach supports **UHC** by ensuring **equitable** and **efficient** resource allocation, making it the preferred choice for **MaHTAS** evaluations to balance **cost**, **outcomes**, and **patient-centered care**.

**Question**: Analyze how **economic evaluation** supports **UHC** in Malaysia, focusing on **MySalam** and **national formularies**. Discuss **timing**, **perspective**, and **evaluation types**. Propose **policy recommendations** with global lessons.

**Answer**: **Economic evaluation** supports **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)** in Malaysia by ensuring **equitable access** to healthcare through **value-driven** resource allocation. Defined as _a comparative analysis of costs and consequences_, it addresses **scarcity** by prioritizing **high-impact interventions** like **MySalam** (health insurance for low-income groups) and **national formularies** (**MyHEALTH**, **MyHD**).

**Timing** is critical: evaluations should align with **budgeting cycles** or **MaHTAS** **HTA** reviews to influence **formulary listing** or **program expansion**. For example, evaluating **MySalam**‚Äôs cost-effectiveness during policy planning ensures **timely adoption**. **Perspective** shapes outcomes: the **patient perspective** captures **OOP costs** (e.g., co-payments for **MySalam** beneficiaries), ensuring **equity**, while the **health system perspective** focuses on **medical costs**, supporting **budget efficiency**. The **societal perspective**, recommended by **WHO**, includes **indirect costs** (e.g., productivity losses), aligning with **UHC**‚Äôs holistic goals.

**CUA**, using **QALYs**, is preferred for **MySalam** and **formulary** evaluations, as it captures **quality of life** (e.g., RM 100,000/QALY for a new drug). **CEA** may assess **cases prevented**, but **CUA** better supports **HTA**. **Full evaluations** compare alternatives (e.g., new drug vs. standard care), using **ICER** ($\text{ICER}=\frac{\Delta\text{Cost}}{\Delta\text{Effectiveness}}$) to ensure **efficiency**.

**Policy Recommendations**:

- **Integrate CUA**: Use **QALYs** in **MaHTAS** to evaluate **MySalam** and **formulary** drugs, ensuring **patient-centered** outcomes.
- **Align Timing**: Conduct evaluations during **budget cycles** for **actionable** insights.
- **Balance Perspectives**: Combine **patient** and **societal** perspectives to address **equity** and **sustainability**.
- **Prioritize High-Value Drugs**: Fund **formulary** drugs with low **ICER**, supporting **UHC**.

Globally, **economic evaluation** ensures **UHC** by prioritizing **equitable**, **efficient** interventions, with Malaysia‚Äôs **MySalam** as a model for low-income health schemes.
