## üìö 10. Case Study: HER2+ Breast Cancer

This case study applies the principles of **economic evaluation** to a real-world scenario, comparing **Drug A** (a new targeted therapy) versus **Drug B** (standard chemotherapy) for women with **early-stage HER2+ breast cancer**. Presented as part of the lecture on **May 30, 2025**, this section illustrates how to conduct a **full economic evaluation**, integrating **costing**, **outcome measurement**, **incremental analysis**, and **threshold comparison** to inform **policy decisions** in Malaysia‚Äôs resource-constrained healthcare system üåç. By analyzing **costs**, **outcomes**, and **cost-effectiveness**, this case study highlights the practical application of economic evaluation in prioritizing **high-impact interventions** while addressing **budget constraints** and **equity** concerns ü©∫.

### üìñ Scenario

- **Context**: Comparing **Drug A** (new targeted therapy) vs. **Drug B** (standard chemotherapy) for women with **early-stage HER2+ breast cancer**.
- **Parameters**:
    - **Target Population**: Women with early-stage HER2+ breast cancer.
    - **Perspective**: Health system.
    - **Time Horizon**: 5 years.
    - **Discount Rate**: **3%** (simplified for illustration).

**Elaboration**: This **scenario** focuses on a critical decision for Malaysia‚Äôs healthcare system: whether to adopt **Drug A**, a new targeted therapy, over **Drug B**, the standard chemotherapy, for women with **early-stage HER2+ breast cancer**, a condition with significant health and economic implications. The **target population** is clearly defined to ensure the evaluation is relevant to a specific group, aligning with clinical needs. The **health system perspective** focuses on **direct medical costs** (e.g., drug acquisition, hospital stays), reflecting the priorities of Malaysia‚Äôs Ministry of Health in managing public healthcare budgets. A **5-year time horizon** captures medium-term costs and outcomes, such as survival and quality of life, while the **3% discount rate** adjusts future values to their present worth, aligning with Malaysia‚Äôs Health Technology Assessment (HTA) guidelines. This scenario sets the stage for a **systematic evaluation**, demonstrating how economic tools guide **policy-relevant** decisions in Malaysia üíâ.

### üìä Input Data

The table below presents the **input data** for the economic evaluation of Drug A and Drug B:

|**Intervention**|**Cost (RM)**|**QALYs Gained**|
|---|---|---|
|Drug B (Standard)|20,000|1.5|
|Drug A (New)|60,000|2.0|

**Elaboration**: The **input data** provide the foundation for comparing **Drug A** and **Drug B**. **Costs** are measured in Malaysian Ringgit (RM), with **Drug B** costing **RM 20,000** and **Drug A** costing **RM 60,000**, reflecting the higher expense of targeted therapies. **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** measure health outcomes, with **Drug B** yielding **1.5 QALYs** and **Drug A** yielding **2.0 QALYs**, indicating better survival and quality of life with the new therapy. These data, derived from clinical trials or costing studies, are critical for Malaysia‚Äôs **health system perspective**, ensuring the evaluation reflects **real-world costs** and **health benefits**. Accurate inputs are essential for **credible results**, guiding decisions on whether to fund a costly intervention like Drug A üìä.

### üßÆ Calculations

- **Incremental Cost**:  
    $$ \text{Cost}_A - \text{Cost}_B = 60,000 - 20,000 = \text{RM 40,000} $$
- **Incremental QALYs**:  
    $$ 2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5 \text{ QALYs} $$
- **ICER**:  
    $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = \text{RM 80,000 per QALY} $$

**Elaboration**: The **calculations** apply **incremental analysis** to quantify the **additional cost** and **benefit** of Drug A over Drug B:

- **Incremental Cost**: Subtracting Drug B‚Äôs cost (RM 20,000) from Drug A‚Äôs cost (RM 60,000) yields $$ \text{RM 60,000 - 20,000 = RM 40,000} $$, representing the **extra cost** of adopting Drug A.
- **Incremental QALYs**: Subtracting Drug B‚Äôs QALYs (1.5) from Drug A‚Äôs QALYs (2.0) gives $$ 2.0 - 1.5 = 0.5 \text{ QALYs} $$, indicating the **additional health benefit** of Drug A.
- **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**: Dividing the incremental cost by the incremental QALYs, $$ \text{ICER} = \frac{40,000}{0.5} = \text{RM 80,000 per QALY} $$, shows the **cost per additional QALY** gained by choosing Drug A.

These calculations are critical in Malaysia, where the **ICER** helps policymakers assess whether the **RM 80,000 per QALY** is worth the investment, balancing **health gains** with **budget constraints** üßÆ.

### üìà Interpretation

- **Thresholds**:
    - **WTP (RM 100,000/QALY)**: Drug A is **cost-effective**.
    - **GDP (RM 50,000/QALY)**: Drug A is **not cost-effective**.
    - **Opportunity Cost (RM 30,000‚Äì50,000/QALY)**: Drug A is **not cost-effective**.
- **Decision Factors**:
    - **Budget constraints**.
    - **Disease severity**.
    - **Equity considerations** (e.g., access for low-income patients).

**Elaboration**: The **interpretation** of the ICER (**RM 80,000/QALY**) involves comparing it to **thresholds** that reflect Malaysia‚Äôs willingness to pay for health gains:

- **WTP Threshold (RM 100,000/QALY)**: Drug A‚Äôs ICER of **RM 80,000/QALY** is below the **Ministry of Health/HTA implied willingness-to-pay (WTP)** threshold (RM 90,000‚Äì120,000/QALY), making it **cost-effective**. This suggests Drug A is a viable investment for Malaysia‚Äôs public health system, offering significant health benefits within acceptable cost limits üåü.
- **GDP Threshold (RM 50,000/QALY)**: Based on WHO-CHOICE‚Äôs 1√ó GDP per capita threshold (~RM 50,000/QALY), Drug A is **not cost-effective**, as its ICER exceeds this limit. This highlights the **simplistic nature** of GDP-based thresholds, which may not account for Malaysia‚Äôs specific **budget constraints** or **health priorities**.
- **Opportunity Cost Threshold (RM 30,000‚Äì50,000/QALY)**: Reflecting the **health gains forgone** when diverting resources, this threshold deems Drug A **not cost-effective**, as its ICER exceeds the range. This is critical in Malaysia, where **scarce resources** require prioritizing interventions with lower opportunity costs üìâ.

**Decision Factors** influence the final recommendation:

- **Budget Constraints**: Malaysia‚Äôs limited healthcare budget may restrict funding for costly interventions like Drug A, despite its cost-effectiveness under the WTP threshold.
- **Disease Severity**: The life-threatening nature of HER2+ breast cancer may justify higher costs, as improved survival and quality of life are critical.
- **Equity Considerations**: Ensuring **access for low-income patients** is vital in Malaysia, where out-of-pocket costs can exacerbate **financial toxicity**. A **health system perspective** may overlook these, but **equity** could tip the decision toward funding Drug A if it addresses unmet needs.

This interpretation underscores the need for **context-sensitive analysis** in Malaysia, balancing **cost-effectiveness**, **health priorities**, and **equity** to guide **policy decisions** üìä.
